    <h1>Rhetcomp Googlegroup</h1>
<p>I've set up a Googlegroup to help colleagues remain connected if/when Twitter goes away. The Rhetcomp list discusses teaching rhetoric and composition in higher ed—first-year composition (FYC), professional and technical writing (PTW), creative writing, and any other kind of writing you can come up with. This list promotes diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.</p>
    <h2>How to Join</h2>
    <p>Visit <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/rhetcomp" target="_blank">https://groups.google.com/g/rhetcomp</a> and use the Join the Group link.</p>
    <h2>Group Rules</h2>
    <p>These rules are evolving and will be updated as necessary.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The list is carefully monitored and, if necessary, will switch to moderation to ensure a welcome space for collegial discussion. My decisions on moderation and removal are final.</li>
      <li>Begin your message with a hashtag that will help recovering Tweeters determine if the message is relevant (e.g., #TeamRhetoric #WomeninTC #CWCon )&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Keep messages reasonably short. This is a Twitter alternative, not a monograph alternative.</li>
      <li>Post only welcoming and diverse messages. I will remove racist, sexist, transphobic, ableist, and any other inappropriate messages. Hate posts are not tolerated.</li>
      <li>Don't be a jerk.</li>
    </ol>
<h2>Sustainability &amp; Longevity</h2>
<p>As long as we have no coup d’etats or explosions of unmanageable hate, this list can remain open for colleagues to use.</p>
