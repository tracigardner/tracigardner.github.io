<h2 style="color: #861f41;font-weight: bold;">Reflections on Rutgers Online 2023</h2>
<p>This is probably not going to be the reflection you are expecting. Still, because they are so personal, these are the things that stand out the most for me from the conference. You see, I gave a presentation at the Rutgers Online Conference: &ldquo;<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.tengrrl.com/Rutgers23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Canvas Analytics and Surveys to Build Teacher Presence</a>.&rdquo; I have given several other presentations on this topic, honing the presentation as I added changes based on current successes and failures. I knew what I was talking about, and I had no worries about the presentation when I proposed it. Little did I know . . . . The event reminded me of the ways that simple choices can make or break the ways that we use technology in educational efforts.</p>
<h3 style="color: #e87722;font-weight: bold;font-size: 14pt;">Challenge of Not Understanding the Presentation Format</h3>
<p> When I saw the conference listed in the PDN schedule, I found details on the event on the Rutgers site and noticed that the deadline for proposals was about a week out. Since TLOS had already paid for everything, I decided to send in a proposal. After all, why not?</p>
<p>The conference website left some details unexplained, which should have been a warning sign. One of the choices on the proposal form asked for the following: “Choose a modality (Live, Pre-recorded with Live Q&amp;A, or Pre-recorded with no Q&amp;A).” I stupidly assumed that Pre-recorded with Live Q&amp;A meant that I would turn in a video that people could watch on their own and then show up for a short, live Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>Instead, I found in the first of three (yes, three) “practice” sessions that I was to prepare a video that would be played live and then answer questions after. The session was to be 45 minutes. If I had understood how the presentation format was defined by the conference planners, I would have chosen one of the other two options. Either would have been better.</p>
<p><em>Lesson learned:</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18px;">Ask questions rather than guessing what the planners want.</p>
<p><em>Application to the classroom:</em></p>
<ul>
   <li>Explain the details in assignments. Be transparent (<a href="https://tilthighered.com/" target="_blank">TILT</a>).</li>
   <li>Ask for questions to give students an opening and invitation for letting me know what they need.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: #e87722;font-weight: bold;font-size: 14pt;">Challenge of Meeting Outside Expectations</h3>
<p>I have given, without exaggeration, dozens and dozens of presentations on diverse topics, all related in some way to teaching with technology. I’m not the most dynamic presenter in the world, but I do okay. That said, I’m not opposed to trying new things and listening to other’s suggestions for how I can improve.</p>
<p>For the session, I was paired with a Rutgers technology specialist who was my technical support for the presentation. In past online presentations I have given, that meant the specialist would introduce me, provide platform reminders (like keep yourself muted), and manage questions in the chat while I managed the presentation itself. The technology specialist instead told me that they would play the videos for me and then manage the questions and answers.</p>
<p>Not only would the technology specialist be in charge of  my presentation video, they also took control of what and how I presented the information. I was told how to record the video, how long it could be, how it was to be arranged into multiple files, what additional materials I had to create, and even what I should say. I scribbled all these directives down, hoping I captured it all, mind racing as I tried to figure out how to meet all these demands.</p>
<p>I created everything and delivered the materials (videos, handouts, additional documentation, shortcuts, links). I followed all the directions, staying up over 24 hours to meet all the expectations by the technology specialist’s deadline. I had checked everything off on the scribbled list.</p>
<p>Imagine how I felt then in my next practice session with the technology specialist when I was asked how and why I had done things as I had. The answer: Because that’s what you told me to do. They began asking me to redo everything in a different way and provide even more materials. This meeting started at 3:30 PM, and the last moment for providing everything was 5 PM. I said there wasn’t time. I was broken. I only wanted the presentation to be over. If I could have figured out how to, I would have withdrawn from the event entirely.</p>
<p><em>Lesson learned:</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18px;">Creativity takes time and freedom, and it’s hurtful when neither is allowed.</p>
<p><em>Application to the classroom:</em></p>
<ul>
   <li>Never take over students’ work. Let them own their creativity.</li>
   <li>Allow ample time for students to work. Avoid short, complicated workflows.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: #e87722;font-weight: bold;font-size: 14pt;">Challenge of Being Unheard (Sometimes Literally)</h3>
<h4 style="color: #861f41;font-style: italic;font-size: 14pt;">Issue the First</h4>
<p>The weekend before the presentation, I received an email from the technology specialist telling me that he had rewritten and reformatted one of my documents. They felt that my piece, as written, was not polished enough for the presentation. It wasn’t. It was instead a *.TXT document set up with links to all the materials.</p>
<p>Since we were to be running the conference platform, videos, two web browsers (Chrome and Firefox, don’t ask), and Canvas,  a lo-fi file that included all the links and could be copied and pasted into the conference chat seemed the best choice. I explained the purpose of the file in the email I had sent with details on everything I had submitted. The technology specialist hadn’t read the  annotations I  sent for the uploaded files.</p>
<p>I replied to the technology specialist, explaining that the document was never meant to be shared with the attendees. I told them that I wanted to share only <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.tengrrl.com/Rutgers23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the link to my session page</a>, which included the slides, the transcript, the handouts, and more. They said they understood, but I suspect  they were disappointed  I didn't appreciate the all-caps and all-italics revision of my document. Come on. I teach technical writing. I would <em>never</em> use such a poorly designed document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it came time for the session, I shared the link to my session page as planned; however, the technology specialist persisted in sharing the link to the *.TXT document repeatedly. Even though I had specifically stated that it was not to be shared and was sharing a completely different link, they continued to ignore my request.</p>
<h4 style="color: #861f41;font-style: italic;font-size: 14pt;">Issue the Second</h4>
<p>I showed up 30 minutes early for my session on March 13, as I was told to. We were to do another practice to ensure that the technology was all working. As had happened during the previous practice session, every time the technology specialist started or stopped the video, the conference platform kicked me out completely. I told the technology specialist that this was happening. It was essentially laughed off as a quirk of the platform. I hoped it would work when the session started, but I really had no faith that it would.</p>
<p>The session started. There were six times  the technology specialist started or stopped the videos. There were six times  I was kicked out of my own session, times when I was supposed to be interacting with the attendees and using some active learning strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked completely unprofessional, as if I didn’t know how to use  technology. I told the technology specialist every time, hoping they would change something. My requests were unheard. Worse yet, I found out later from someone who  attended the session  the technology specialist joked about my disappearances each time. I had not only been literally silenced by the decision to ignore my report of technology issues, but I had also been belittled.</p>
<p><em>Lesson learned:</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18px;">Even years of presentations cannot xxx the hit to the confidence when your requests are ignored.</p>
<p><em>Application to the classroom:</em></p>
<ul>
   <li>Listen to students. Take them seriously. Address their concerns directly.</li>
   <li>Never joke about the frustrations and challenges students face.</li>
</ul>
      <h3 style="color: #e87722;font-weight: bold;font-size: 14pt;">something</h3>
