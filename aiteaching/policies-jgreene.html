    <title>Generative AI Statement and Policies</title>
</head>

    <h2>Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) Statement and Policies</h2>
    <p class="byline">Policy created by Justin Greene (Department of English)</p>


    <p>We are in a brave new world of education, particularly regarding analysis and writing. Generative AI has drastically changed how we do every task. Unlike others, I am not running and hiding from generative AI; I want us to become literate in the ways it can be another useful tool in our thinking and writing toolboxes. However, this does not mean that generative AI will replace you. Although we have machines that can think for and like us, I value what you have to say and want to help you engage with our texts and master our learning outcomes!</p>

    <p>Below are my policies regarding the acceptable and ethical uses of generative AI in this class:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Students do not have to use generative AI at any point if they do not want to. Students who choose not to use these tools will not receive any penalties on their work.</li>
        <li>Students should use generative AI only in the manners suggested on assignment guidelines and during class.</li>
        <li>Students should critically assess and weigh the value of generative AI output to invent, revise, and edit their work.</li>
        <li>Students should document any content from generative AI in final submissions of major projects.</li>
        <li>Students should treat generative AI as a writing and design assistant, like Spellcheck, Grammarly, or PowerPoint suggestions.</li>
        <li>Students should use Microsoft Copilot only.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Copilot is the only VT sponsored generative AI, and it will be the only tool I support in my class.</p>

    <p>Here is the brief reasoning: VT requested that Microsoft not use student data in Copilot&rsquo;s training nor keep student data for future use. Basically, VT has tried to ensure that your personal and educational data is &ldquo;safe.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Although there are more sophisticated and advanced generative AI tools available, Microsoft Copilot is free to VT students and easily accessible through your VT Microsoft account, thus not requiring you to pay for a subscription.</p>

    <p>Students should not use generative AI in manners that violate the Virginia Tech Honor Code. (See &ldquo;Honor Code and Plagiarism&rdquo; section.) Students suspected of unethical use of generative AI may receive failing grades for those assignments and could be subject to Honor Code violations.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Except for the &ldquo;Honor Code,&rdquo; these policies are for my class only. Please make sure you speak with your other professors about their views and policies on generative AI tools before using them for assignments.</p>

    <h2>AI Acknowledgement Statements and MLA Citations</h2>

    <p><strong>Fall 2024 | Dr. Greene</strong></p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Below you will find a list of general acknowledgement statements for the use of generative AI in your projects. These statements are meant to be a way to inform the reader of the hybridity of our new writing and thinking environments. In no way are they intended to degrade or devalue the work you submit for assessment; they are intended to be a marker of honesty and integrity.</p>

    <p>Copy and paste the statement that best describes the level of your use of generative AI during the project sequence at the end of your final draft submission. If projects require a Works Cited page, please paste the Acknowledgement Statement after the last citation. Please feel free to modify these statements for specificity as you see fit. Additionally, please create and include the MLA citations&mdash;in-text and Works Cited&mdash;for any generative AI content used as quotes, summaries, or paraphrases in your final submissions.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to speak with me or email me or use the Canvas email tool.</p>

    <h3>AI Acknowledgement Statements</h3>

    <p><strong>No Use of Generative AI at ANY POINT in the Writing Process</strong>&mdash;I firmly and honestly admit to not using generative AI to aid my reading, thinking, and/or writing during this project. All ideas and words read/viewed in the final submission are my own. The only inclusion of others&rsquo; ideas or words may come from primary and/or secondary sources, which are cited according to the project guidelines to maintain academic integrity.</p>

    <p><strong>Use of Generative AI During Invention Stage ONLY</strong>&mdash;I firmly and honestly admit to using generative AI during the invention stage of my project. Generative AI assisted me in developing a topic, understanding perspectives, brainstorming points/ideas, and other initial writing tasks. All generative AI content was thoroughly revised and edited by me to, ultimately, make it my own. Generative AI sparked my creativity and critical thinking so that I could work past any writer&rsquo;s block or other starting issues.</p>

    <p><strong>Use of Generative AI During Revision and Editing Stage ONLY</strong>&mdash;I firmly and honestly admit to using generative AI during the revision and editing stages of my project. Generative AI provided feedback on my draft, serving as a critical reader responding to my ideas, argument, organization, and other global aspects of my paper. Generative AI served as a proofreader of my draft, checking for syntax and other local issues with language usage. I critically assessed the feedback and made revision/editing choices based on my own understanding of the project&rsquo;s purpose, audience, topic, context, and writerly identity, thus using generative AI feedback in the same manner as I would human feedback on my rough drafts.</p>

    <p><strong>Use of Generative AI During Invention, Revision, and Editing Stages ONLY</strong>&mdash;I firmly and honestly admit to using generative AI in the initial and review stages of my project. Generative AI assisted me in developing a topic, understanding perspectives, brainstorming points/ideas, and other initial writing tasks. All generative AI content was thoroughly revised and edited by me to, ultimately, make it my own. Generative AI sparked my creativity and critical thinking so that I could work past any writer&rsquo;s block or other starting issues. Additionally, generative AI provided feedback on my draft, serving as a critical reader responding to my ideas, argument, organization, and other global aspects of my paper. Generative AI served as a proofreader of my draft, checking for syntax and other local issues with language usage.

    <p><strong>Use of Generative AI During ALL Writing Process Stages</strong>&mdash;I firmly and honestly admit to using generative AI throughout each phase of my project&rsquo;s development. Generative AI became a tool I returned to often to not only spark my thinking, but deepen my understanding of my topic, my argument, and my writing. Generative AI helped me summarize and cite my sources. I critically assessed all generative AI output for accuracy and relevancy to make sure that its content was appropriate for my project and its purpose and claims. I firmly and honestly admit that I did not borrow any material in my paper from generative AI; I created all aspects of the final draft and used generative AI as a guide for my project&rsquo;s completion.</p>

    <p><strong>Use of Generative AI as Source Material in Final Submission ONLY</strong>&mdash;I firmly and honestly admit to borrowing material from generative AI, thus treating it as a secondary source. I have quoted, paraphrased, and/or summarized its output, and I have included appropriate in-text citations after the synthesized content. I have included an MLA citation for all generative AI prompt content I used in my project.</p>

    <h3>MLA Citations</h3>

    <p>For citing content from generative AI, please use the guidelines provided by the Modern Language Association (MLA): &ldquo;<a href="https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwoJa2BhBPEiwA0l0ImDOSBE1dZ7KPj6ORdF183uVKdUKR1b5FH15yLGf8jwMJSo7EzDlyURoCRoMQAvD_BwE">How do I cite generative AI in MLA Style?</a>&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If you have questions or want me to look over your citations, please speak with me, set up an office hours meeting, or email me. <a href="https://lib.vt.edu/study-learn/writing-center.html">The Writing Center</a> is another great resource for helping you all navigate generative AI usage and attribution not only within this class but also others if allowed. Please schedule an appointment with a WC Coach if you would like help with other citation formats for generative AI.</p>
