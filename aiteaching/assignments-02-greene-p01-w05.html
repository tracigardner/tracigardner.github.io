    <h2>Week 5:<br>Invention Writing #5: Critically Looking at Our Work (Reflective Statement on Project One)</h2>

    <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Reflective Practice</p>

    <h3>Prompt:</h3>
    <p>You are an instructor of freshman composition. your students have completed a personal narrative essay on the concept of home, and you want them to reflect on their learning during the assignment. Craft 5 questions that prompt them to think critically and reflect on their writing skills, the learning outcomes involved in the course (<em>Rhetorical Knowledge, Writing Processes, Multimodal Transformation, and Reflective Practice</em>), <em>things they can improve as the course progresses</em>, and <em>things they find interesting about the class so far</em>.</p>

    <h3>Output:</h3>

    <p>Certainly. Here&rsquo;s a revised set of questions incorporating references to generative AI use in the writing process:</p>

    <ol class="skipline">
        <li>How did you adapt your writing style and tone to effectively convey your personal experience of &ldquo;home&rdquo; to your audience? If you used generative AI tools for brainstorming or editing, how did they influence your rhetorical choices? (<em>Rhetorical Knowledge</em>)</li>
        <li>Describe your writing process for this essay, including any use of AI tools. What strategies, both traditional and AI-assisted, worked well? What would you do differently next time to improve your approach? (<em>Writing Processes</em>)</li>
        <li>How did you use visualization techniques (such as mind mapping, sketching, or AI-generated concept maps) during your drafting process? In what ways did these visual methods help or hinder your ability to develop key points for your essay?</li>
        <li>Reflecting on your essay, what do you consider your strongest writing skill? Which area needs the most improvement as we progress through the course? How might you use AI tools ethically to support this improvement? (<em>Reflective Practice</em>)</li>
        <li>How has this assignment, including any AI-assisted components, shaped your understanding of personal narrative writing? What aspects of integrating AI into the writing process have you found most interesting or challenging so far?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These revised questions maintain the focus on critical reflection and the course learning outcomes while incorporating the use of generative AI in the writing process. They encourage students to think about how AI tools might influence their writing strategies, rhetorical choices, and overall learning experience.</p>
