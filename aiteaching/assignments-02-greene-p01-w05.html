    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <ol class="skipline">
        <li>Use the following questions to reflect on your writing process and your use of Generative AI on this project. As you work, think about how AI tools might influence your writing strategies, rhetorical choices, and overall learning experience:<br><br>
            <ul>

                <li>How did you adapt your writing style and tone to effectively convey your personal experience of &ldquo;home&rdquo; to your audience? If you used generative AI tools for brainstorming or editing, how did they influence your rhetorical choices? (<em>Rhetorical Knowledge</em>)</li>
                <li>Describe your writing process for this essay, including any use of AI tools. What strategies, both traditional and AI-assisted, worked well? What would you do differently next time to improve your approach? (<em>Writing Processes</em>)</li>
                <li>How did you use visualization techniques (such as mind mapping, sketching, or AI-generated concept maps) during your drafting process? In what ways did these visual methods help or hinder your ability to develop key points for your essay?</li>
                <li>Reflecting on your essay, what do you consider your strongest writing skill? Which area needs the most improvement as we progress through the course? How might you use AI tools ethically to support this improvement? (<em>Reflective Practice</em>)</li>
                <li>How has this assignment, including any AI-assisted components, shaped your understanding of personal narrative writing? What aspects of integrating AI into the writing process have you found most interesting or challenging so far?</li>
            </ul>
