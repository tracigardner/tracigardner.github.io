    <h2>Example Student Responses</h2>
    <h3>Music Therapy Major&rsquo;s Response</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <h4>Journal Entries for ChatGPT</h4>

        <ul class="skipline">
            <li><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> &ldquo;How can AI assist in creating personalized playlists for patients with depression?&rdquo;<br>
                <strong>Response:</strong> Suggested using genre preferences, lyric sentiment analysis, and biometric data.<br>
                <strong>My Note:</strong> Great starting point, but lacks cultural nuance.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> &ldquo;I work with Syrian refugees. How can AI help create music that aids in trauma processing?&rdquo;<br>
                <strong>Response:</strong> Suggested maqam scales and traditional instruments.<br>
                <strong>My Note:</strong> Culturally informed, but missed re-traumatization risk.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> &ldquo;Given re-traumatization risks, how else can AI support Syrian refugee music therapy?&rdquo;<br>
                <strong>Response:</strong> Use GANs to generate culturally resonant music without narratives.<br>
                <strong>My Note:</strong> Showcases adaptability and interdisciplinary knowledge.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Journal Entries for Midjourney</h4>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> &ldquo;Create visual music score for anxiety reduction&rdquo;<br>
                <strong>Output:</strong> Calming abstract lines.<br>
                <strong>My Note:</strong> Aesthetically pleasing, lacks therapeutic depth.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> &ldquo;Visual score with CBT techniques and soft palette&rdquo;<br>
                <strong>Output:</strong> Grounding imagery and soft colors.<br>
                <strong>My Note:</strong> Better, still potentially too abstract.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> &ldquo;Manga-style CBT visual score for teens&rdquo;<br>
                <strong>Output:</strong> Hero conquers &ldquo;Anxiety Monster&rdquo; using CBT tools.<br>
                <strong>My Note:</strong> Engaging, age-appropriate, therapeutically sound.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Short Reflection</h4>
        <p>In my journey through the AI landscape, I&rsquo;ve discovered tools with profound potential for music therapy&mdash;yet this potential is tempered by significant limitations and ethical considerations, particularly when working with vulnerable populations.</p>

        <p>ChatGPT&rsquo;s suggestions were insightful but initially lacked cultural nuance, which improved with specific prompting. Its adaptability, especially using GANs to generate culturally appropriate music, demonstrated interdisciplinary potential.</p>

        <p>Midjourney showed similar promise. Generic visuals evolved into powerful therapeutic tools when guided by CBT-informed prompts, culminating in a manga-style score that resonated deeply with youth clients.</p>

        <p>However, both tools revealed problematic biases—defaulting to white, able-bodied figures—a reminder of AI&rsquo;s current limitations and the necessity of diverse datasets (IBM, 2023).</p>

        <p>Overall, this experience highlighted AI&rsquo;s potential as an ally in music therapy when critically and ethically engaged. We must lead the human-machine partnership with awareness and empathy.</p>

    <h3>Biology Major&rsquo;s Response</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <h4>Journal Notes on Using ChatGPT for Genetics Research</h4>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li><strong>Capability:</strong> Impressively summarized CRISPR-Cas9 mechanics and its applications in genetic diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Provided outdated info on a 2019 clinical trial, missing recent breakthroughs.</li>
            <li><strong>Bias:</strong> Over-emphasized Western research, overlooking key Asian-led CRISPR innovations.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Great for grasping concepts, but risky for current research. Must cross-check with journals.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Journal Notes on Using DALL-E for Biological Visualizations</h4>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li><strong>Capability:</strong> Created a stunning, accurate neuron image with myelin sheaths.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Asked for &ldquo;protein folding simulation,&rdquo; got stylized art, not scientific accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Bias:</strong> When prompted for &ldquo;human cells,&rdquo; predominantly produced white skin tones.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Excellent for educational visuals but needs expert tweaking. Bias makes it problematic for inclusive medical education.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>500-Word Reflection</h4>
        <p>ChatGPT&rsquo;s ability to summarize dense scientific material is one of its most impressive and useful features for students like me&mdash;especially when it comes to understanding complex subjects like genetics. In my biology class, for example, I&rsquo;ve encountered topics like epigenetics, gene regulation, and CRISPR that are packed with terminology and layered concepts. When I ask ChatGPT to explain these topics in simpler terms or to provide a summary of a long academic article, it can deliver clear and digestible overviews that help me build a foundation. This is especially helpful when I&rsquo;m struggling to make sense of a textbook passage or preparing for a test. However, I&rsquo;ve also noticed that ChatGPT sometimes gives outdated information or oversimplifies things to the point where key nuances are lost. Genetics is a fast-evolving field, and new findings emerge constantly&mdash;so relying solely on ChatGPT without checking peer-reviewed sources could lead to confusion or even learning inaccuracies. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve learned to treat ChatGPT&rsquo;s answers as starting points. I use them to guide my reading or frame my questions, but I always double-check important details with reliable scientific literature.</p>

        <p>DALL&middot;E, the AI image generator, opens up a different kind of possibility. I experimented with it by asking for visualizations of cellular structures, DNA transcription, and even genetic disorders. The images it produced were surprisingly creative and sometimes even more engaging than what I find in standard textbooks. I can see real potential for this kind of tool to make biology materials more visual and appealing&mdash;especially for students who learn better through images than text. For instance, an AI-generated illustration of how CRISPR edits genes could show the concept in a fresh, intuitive way that makes it click. But this power also raises important questions. When I asked DALL&middot;E to generate images of people with certain genetic traits or conditions, I noticed it tended to reflect stereotypical or biased representations, particularly in terms of race, gender, and body type. This shows that AI tools like DALL&middot;E are only as fair as the data they&rsquo;re trained on&mdash;and that bias can show up in subtle but harmful ways. In a medical or educational context, these biases aren&rsquo;t just academic problems; they can reinforce misinformation or exclusions.</p>

        <p>In the end, I see huge potential in both ChatGPT and DALL&middot;E to support learning in genetics and biology&mdash;but only if we use them critically. ChatGPT can help break down complexity and make science more approachable, but we need to verify its content with up-to-date research. DALL&middot;E can enhance our understanding through powerful visuals, but we must be aware of and challenge its representational limitations. As students, our job isn&rsquo;t just to consume what AI gives us, but to question it, compare it with other sources, and think about its impact. These tools are not replacements for deep learning or critical thinking&mdash;they&rsquo;re companions we must learn to use wisely.</p>
