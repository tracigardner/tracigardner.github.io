    <h3>Invention Writing #2: Visualizing Definition Criteria for Project One</h3>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Rhetorical Knowledge, Writing Processes, Multimodal Transformation, and Reflective Practice</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Refer to the <a href="https://aiteaching.vt.domains/sample-assignments/by-cohort-members/project-one-week-one-definitional-personal-narrative-on-the-concept-home/">Week One Invention Writing</a> and choose either the attached Blueprint PDF or Copilot Designer to develop a visual image of your definitional criteria that make up your version of home.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blueprint option:</strong> Fill each room with concepts, people, phrases, etc. that you associate with those spaces. (See attached example.)</li>
            <li><strong>AI designed image:</strong> Modify the following prompt:
                <blockquote>You are a first-year college student from ________ and are away from home for the first real time in your life. You are tasked with creating a visual image of your definition of home that needs to provide evidence of emotions associated with specific rooms. Generate a blueprint that provides ideas associated with a kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathroom in a house.</blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Get creative. Here&rsquo;s your chance to illustrate connections in a visual way.</li>
        <li>Push your definitions! Think about how ideas about &ldquo;home&rdquo; can take many forms and occur in many writing spaces. Think about key moments, people, objects, emotions, etc. that are specific examples of components of your definitions.</li>
        <li>After you or the AI has created a blueprint, analyze and reflect on the output:
            <ul>
                <li>Why did you or the AI fill the space with certain things, emotions, etc.?</li>
                <li>What commonalities do you notice between rooms?</li>
                <li>Are there specific traits, people, etc. that you or AI associate with these spaces?</li>
                <li>Why did you believe you or AI filled these spaces in this manner?</li>
                <li>What does it reveal about the concept of &ldquo;home&rdquo; that could be expanded into a thesis, main points, and examples in Project One?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
