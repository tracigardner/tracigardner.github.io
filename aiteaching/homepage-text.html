    <p>Welcome to the website of the Summer 2024 faculty cohort on Teaching in the Age of Generative AI! We spent the summer teaching and learning from one another as we explored the rapid rise of generative AI in higher education and considered its impact on teaching and learning at Virginia Tech.</p>
    <p>The program was designed to help cohort members design or redesign assignments, assessments, and classroom activities to leverage generative AI&mdash;and to ensure that AI is used responsibly and appropriately.</p>

    <p>We met regularly throughout the summer</a> to share and refine our individual work, and to collaboratively develop resources and recommendations to aide other faculty at Virginia Tech as they consider integrating generative AI into their courses.</p>

    <p>This site is designed to serve as a resource for educators interested in exploring the possibilities of incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into their teaching practices. We understand that the concept of AI can be both exciting and daunting, so we hope that this site will address your questions and concerns while highlighting the potential benefits this technology can offer, as well as helpful resources.
