    </figure>As AI becomes more prevalent in higher education and society at large, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications of these powerful technologies. By understanding and addressing these issues, we can work towards using AI responsibly and beneficially.</p>
    <h2 style="clear:none;">Key Ethical Concerns in AI</h2>
    <dl class="skipline">
        <dt>Bias and Fairness</dt>
        <dd>AI systems can perpetuate or amplify existing biases in data and society, so we must ensure fair and equitable outcomes for all stakeholders.</dd>
        <dt>Privacy and Data Protection</dt>
        <dd>When we integrate AI into our classes (or use it for our own work) we need to ensure that it is collecting and using student and faculty data responsibly. Virginia Tech suggests that in order to protect personal information from misuse or breaches, teachers should encourage their students to use Bing Copilot, which has a high level of privacy.</dd>
        <dt>Transparency and Explainability</dt>
        <dd>In order to ensure that we are making the best possible decisions regarding the use of AI, we should develop at least a basic understanding of how AI systems make decisions. Using vetted systems helps ensure accountability in AI-assisted processes.</dd>
        <dt>Academic Integrity</dt>
        <dd>If we incorporate AI into our classrooms, we must emphasize balancing the use of AI tools with original work and critical thinking. One of the ways we can do that is by developing specific policies for appropriate AI use in coursework and research. For more on academic integrity, see below. For more on policies, see Syllabus Statements [LINK].</dd>
        <dt>Changing Roles</dt>
        <dd>Part of our responsibility as educators is preparing students to enter the workforce with the critical thinking and writing skills they need to succeed. Today, we must also help prepare them for entering an AI-integrated workforce.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Ethical Considerations in Higher Education</h2>
    <p>When it comes to AI in higher education, ethical issues arise for both educators and students.</p>
    <h3>Ethical Issues for Educators</h3>
    <dl class="skipline">
        <dt>Fairness in AI-Assisted Teaching</dt>
        <dd>We must ensure that the AI tools we use don't disadvantage certain student groups. We must also balance AI assistance with maintaining personal connections to students.</dd>
        <dt>Professional Development</dt>
        <dd>Keeping up with AI advancements and their ethical implications and developing skills to use AI tools responsibly and effectively are two key considerations for teachers.</dd>
        <dt>Curriculum Design</dt>
        <dd>If we decide to allow students to use AI in our courses, we must Integrate some form of AI literacy into our course content, as well as balance traditional skills with AI-augmented learning.</dd>
        <dt>Assessment Integrity</dt>
        <dd>Using AI for grading (which we can do) requires us to maintain fairness and accuracy. We should avoid using any &ldquo;AI detection&rdquo; platforms to review student work, as doing so can result in <a href="https://themarkup.org/machine-learning/2023/08/14/ai-detection-tools-falsely-accuse-international-students-of-cheating">false positives</a>.</dd>
        <dt>Data Handling</dt>
        <dd>AI systems store data; as a result, we should use the system vetted by the university</dt>
        <dd>Bing Copilot. It offers the highest level of student data protection. We should also indicate clearly when we intend to collect and use student data for research purposes.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Ethical Issues Related to Student Use of AI</h3>
    <dl class="skipline">
        <dt>Academic Integrity</dt>
        <dd>Even if we allow students to use AI, we are responsible for encouraging original thinking. We must also clearly define and publicize acceptable use of AI tools in our coursework.</dd>
        <dt>Equal Access</dt>
        <dd>We must ensure that all students have access to AI tools, regardless of economic status. We should not require students to subscribe to any AI services. We should also provide educational support for students less familiar with AI technologies.</dd>
        <dt>AI Literacy</dt>
        <dd>If we integrate AI into our coursework, we must teach students to critically evaluate AI-generated information and help them understand AI's limitations and potential biases</dd>
        <dt>Career Preparation</dt>
        <dd>AI is changing the shape of the workforce into which our students will enter. As a result, we must do what we can to not only prepare them for that workforce but also teach them to balance AI skills with uniquely human capabilities.</dd>
        <dt>Mental Health and Well-being</dt>
        <dd>Human connections are crucial for a positive learning environment. If we integrate AI into our classes, we must do all we can to maintain those connections. We should also teach students to avoid over-reliance on AI for academic or personal support.</dd>
        <dt>Ethical AI Use</dt>
        <dd>Teaching students about responsible and ethical AI use and the potential societal impacts of AI are two crucial aspects of integrating AI into our classes.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Navigating the Intersection</h3>
    <p>The ethical landscape of AI in education requires a collaborative approach:</p>
    <dl class="skipline">
        <dt>Open Dialogue</dt>
        <dd>As teachers, we must be willing to foster discussions with our students about AI use and its implications.</dd>
        <dt>Clear Guidelines</dt>
        <dd>We must develop and communicate clear policies on AI use in academic settings.</dd>
        <dt>Adaptive Policies</dt>
        <dd>AI is advancing quickly, so we must be willing to regularly review and update our AI policies to keep pace with new developments.</dd>
        <dt>Ethical Leadership</dt>
        <dd>Educators must model responsible AI use and ethical decision-making for students.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Remember, the goal isn&rsquo;t to avoid AI, but to integrate it thoughtfully and ethically into the educational experience. By addressing these ethical considerations proactively, we can create an educational environment that harnesses the benefits of AI while upholding academic integrity, fairness, and the core values of education.</p>
