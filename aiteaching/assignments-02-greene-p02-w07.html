    <p class="byline">Assignment created by Justin Greene (Department of English)</p>
    <p class="series-overview">This assignment is the second week of a five-week series, usually used during the seventh week of the term. The Reading Spaces series is usually preceded by the Personal Narrative series and then the Rhetorical Analysis of Generative AI series.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This activity encourages students to think critically about how reading materials contribute to the rhetorical nature of a space, while also developing their visual literacy and descriptive writing skills.</p>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Rhetorical Knowledge, Writing Processes, Multimodal Transformation, and Reflective Practice</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Students will analyze how reading materials contribute to the rhetorical appeals (logos, pathos, ethos, kairos, and exigence) of a chosen space by arranging and photographing the materials within that space.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol class="skipline">
        <li><strong>Return to your chosen &ldquo;reading&rdquo; space.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Gather reading materials:</strong> Collect 5&ndash;7 diverse reading materials that you believe contribute to or reflect the rhetorical nature of your chosen space. These can include books, magazines, newspapers, flyers, brochures, or digital reading devices. Think broadly and creatively about the things you &ldquo;read&rdquo; in this space.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrange and photograph:</strong>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Place your reading materials within the chosen space.</li>
                <li>Take photographs of your arrangement:
                    <ul>
                        <li>One group shot showing all materials in the space</li>
                        <li>2&ndash;3 close-up shots of individual items or small groups of items</li>
                        <li>1&ndash;2 medium shots showing how the materials interact with the space</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Write descriptions:</strong> For each photograph, write a 1&ndash;3 sentence description explaining how the reading materials contribute to the space&rsquo;s rhetorical appeals. Consider:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logos:</strong> How do the materials appeal to logic or reason?</li>
                <li><strong>Pathos:</strong> How do they evoke emotions?</li>
                <li><strong>Ethos:</strong> How do they establish credibility or authority?</li>
                <li><strong>Kairos:</strong> How do they relate to the timeliness or appropriateness of the space?</li>
                <li><strong>Exigence:</strong> What urgent need or problem do they address?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reflect:</strong> Write a brief reflection (150&ndash;250 words) on how the arrangement of reading materials affects the overall rhetorical impact of the space.</li>

        <li><strong>Weekly submission</strong>: Submit these items:
            <ul>
                <li>Your photographs (1 group shot, 2&ndash;3 close-ups, 1&ndash;2 medium shots)</li>
                <li>Include 1&ndash;3 sentence descriptions for each photograph</li>
                <li>Include your 150&ndash;250-word reflection</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
