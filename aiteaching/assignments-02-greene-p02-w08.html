                <li>An introduction that sets up your chosen reading space</li>
                <li>A tentative thesis statement about the meaning of &ldquo;reading&rdquo; and the importance of your chosen space for reading</li>
                <li>Description and analysis of at least 3 photographs, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>At least 1 establishing shot of your reading space</li>
                        <li>At least 1 close-up shot of a specific object or detail</li>
                        <li>At least 1 medium shot providing context</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>1&ndash;3 sentence captions for each photograph</li>
                <li>Initial analysis of how your space and the objects within it relate to your understanding of &ldquo;reading&rdquo;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Follow this writing advice as you draft your photo essay:
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li>Focus on describing and analyzing your space and the reading activities that occur there.</li>
                <li>Consider how different types of &ldquo;reading&rdquo; (e.g., books, digital media, environmental cues) happen in your chosen space.</li>
                <li>Try to go beyond surface-level observations to provide deeper insights about your space and its significance to your reading habits.</li>
                <li>This draft is a starting point. Don&rsquo;t worry about perfection &ndash; the goal is to get your initial ideas down and begin structuring your essay. We&rsquo;ll refine and expand this draft as we progress through the project.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For your weekly submission, turn in your 750-word draft with 3 photographs and captions.</li>

        <li>Prepare for next week, when we&rsquo;ll engage in peer review to help you further develop your ideas and prepare for the final 1500&ndash;2000-word essay with 6 photographs.</li>
    </ol>
