        <li>An introduction that sets up your chosen reading space</li>
        <li>A tentative thesis statement about the meaning of &ldquo;reading&rdquo; and the importance of your chosen space for reading</li>

        <li>Initial analysis of how your space and the objects within it relate to your understanding of &ldquo;reading&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Try to go beyond surface-level observations to provide deeper insights about your space and its significance to your reading habits.</li>
        <li>This draft is a starting point. Don&rsquo;t worry about perfection &ndash; the goal is to get your initial ideas down and begin structuring your essay. We&rsquo;ll refine and expand this draft as we progress through the project.</li>
    </ul>
