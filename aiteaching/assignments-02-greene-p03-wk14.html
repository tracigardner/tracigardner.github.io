    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>These questions encourage students to reflect on their application of course concepts, their engagement with the writing process, their understanding of rhetorical strategies, and their personal growth through the project. While the document doesn&rsquo;t explicitly mention multimodal transformation for this project, the questions focus on the other key learning outcomes emphasized in the assignment.</p>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Reflective Practice</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Respond to the following questions to reflect on your project:</p>
    <ol class="skipline">
        <li><strong>Rhetorical Knowledge:</strong> How did your understanding of rhetorical appeals (logos, pathos, ethos, and kairos) evolve as you analyzed the generative AI&rsquo;s output? Can you provide a specific example from your analysis where you identified an effective or ineffective use of these appeals?</li>
        <li><strong>Genre Conventions:</strong> In what ways did you adhere to the conventions of a rhetorical analysis essay? How did understanding these conventions shape your approach to analyzing the AI-generated content?</li>
        <li><strong>Writing Processes:</strong> Describe your writing process for this project, from the initial invention stages to the final draft. How did the weekly draft materials and invention writings contribute to the development of your analysis and thesis?</li>
        <li><strong>Reflective Practice:</strong> How has this project changed your perspective on generative AI&rsquo;s capabilities in analytical writing? What insights did you gain about your own critical thinking and analytical skills through this process?</li>
        <li><strong>Rhetorical Knowledge/Reflective Practice:</strong> Consider your intended audience of college-educated AI-skeptics. How did this audience influence your rhetorical choices in presenting your analysis? What strategies did you use to either support or challenge their skepticism?</li>
    </ol>
