    <h1>Principles of Community &amp; AI</h1>

    <p>Creating thoughtful, inclusive, and ethically grounded course policies is essential when working with emerging technologies like generative AI. These tools are evolving quickly&mdash;and so are students&rsquo; experiences with them. Some may arrive with confidence and curiosity, others with hesitation or limited access. As you set expectations for AI use, it helps to start with values that can guide decision-making, support fairness, and foster trust in your classroom.</p>

    <p>Virginia Tech&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.vt.edu/principles-of-community.html">Principles of Community</a> offer just such a foundation. These shared commitments emphasize respect, open-mindedness, and personal integrity&mdash;all of which can shape how you talk about, manage, and teach responsible AI use.</p>

    <h2>Start with Shared Commitments</h2>

    <p>The <em>Principles of Community</em> affirm our dedication to:</p>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Creating an environment that is inclusive and affirming</li>
        <li>Encouraging free expression and respectful dialogue</li>
        <li>Fostering community through mutual respect and engagement</li>
        <li>Pursuing knowledge and understanding with integrity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These values aren&rsquo;t just abstract ideals&mdash;they can shape how you build AI policies that reflect your teaching goals and your students&rsquo; needs. As you set expectations, you have an opportunity to model transparency, build trust, and help students use new tools in ways that support&mdash;not replace&mdash;their learning.</p>

    <h2>How the Principles Can Guide Your Approach</h2>

    <p>Here are a few ways to put the <em>Principles of Community</em> into practice when setting AI expectations:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li><strong>Recognize differences in access and experience:</strong> Not every student will come in knowing how to use AI tools&mdash;or even what they are. If you allow or require AI use, let students know what tools are free, what you recommend, and what alternatives are available. A little guidance can go a long way in leveling the playing field.</li>

        <li><strong>Promote integrity through reflection:</strong> When you explain <em>why</em> AI use is allowed or restricted in a particular assignment, students are more likely to understand and respect the boundaries. Encouraging them to reflect on how they used AI&mdash;and how it affected their thinking&mdash;can deepen their learning and support ethical decision-making.</li>

        <li><strong>Make space for conversation:</strong> Students may have strong feelings, curiosity, or confusion about AI. Give them space to talk about it. Whether it&rsquo;s a five-minute check-in or a full-class discussion, you can model respectful dialogue and collaborative problem-solving.</li>

        <li><strong>Support student agency:</strong> Clear policies give students the freedom to explore new tools while staying within the guidelines. When you invite students to make intentional choices about AI use, you help them build self-awareness and ownership of their learning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical Strategies</h2>

    <p>Here are a few easy ways to connect your teaching about AI to the <em>Principles of Community</em>:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Bring the Principles into your syllabus or an early class discussion when introducing your AI policy.</li>
        <li>Use reflection questions like:
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li>How do AI tools help&mdash;or hinder&mdash;your learning?</li>
                <li>What does responsible use of AI look like in your major or field?</li>
                <li>How can you use AI in a way that reflects your values and our community standards?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Offer students templates or examples for documenting their AI use.</li>
        <li>Let students know whether specific AI tools are required, optional, or off-limits and why.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>

    <p>By using the <em>Principles of Community</em> to frame your AI policies, you&rsquo;re doing more than setting rules&mdash;you&rsquo;re helping shape a culture of shared responsibility, respect, and reflection. That kind of teaching supports all learners, especially as they navigate complex new technologies with your guidance.</p>
