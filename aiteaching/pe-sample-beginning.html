    <p>What prompts should a beginner use to begin interacting with an LLM?</p>


    <p>These prompts are designed to give you a broad understanding of the LLM&rsquo;s capabilities, its potential applications in education, and important considerations for its use. As you become more comfortable, you can start crafting more specific prompts related to your teaching needs.</p>
