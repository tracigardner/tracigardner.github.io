    <h2>Exploring Our &ldquo;Reading Space&rdquo;</h2>

    <p>Assignment created by Justin Greene (Department of English), with Copilot</p>

    <p>This activity encourages students to apply rhetorical concepts to a familiar environment, deepening their understanding of how spaces can be &ldquo;read&rdquo; and analyzed. The photographic element adds a visual component that can be used for multimodal compositions.</p>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Rhetorical Knowledge, Writing Processes, Multimodal Transformation, and Reflective Practice</p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Students will analyze and describe a personal reading space through the lens of rhetorical concepts: logos, pathos, ethos, kairos, and exigence.</p>


    <h3>Activity Steps</h3>

    <h4>Space Selection</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose a space where you frequently &ldquo;read&rdquo; or study.</li>
        <li>This could be a personal space (bedroom, living room, etc.) or a public area (library, caf&eacute;, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Observation and Documentation</h4>
    <ol class="skipline">
        <li>Visit your chosen space at least twice throughout the week. Take notes on the physical characteristics, ambiance, and your personal feelings about the space.</li>
        <li>As you record notes, consider the rhetorical appeals the space makes:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logos:</strong> How does the space&rsquo;s layout or organization appeal to logic or practicality?</li>
                <li><strong>Pathos:</strong> What emotions does the space evoke? How do colors, textures, or objects contribute to this? How do people or lack of people affect the emotional quality of the space?</li>
                <li><strong>Ethos:</strong> How does the space reflect or establish credibility (e.g., presence of books, certificates)?</li>
                <li><strong>Kairos:</strong> How is the space suited (or not) for the current moment or purpose of reading? Does the space change over time&mdash;is it different at various points of the day?</li>
                <li><strong>Exigence:</strong> What need or demand does this reading space fulfill?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Take 5&ndash;7 photographs that capture different aspects of the space.</li>
        <li>Try to capture at least one of the following shot types:
            <ul>
                <li>Establishing or wide angle shot</li>
                <li>High angle shot</li>
                <li>Medium shot</li>
                <li>Close up</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
