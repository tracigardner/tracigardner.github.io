    <p class="byline">Assignment created by Justin Greene (Department of English)</p>
    <p>This assignment is the third week of a five-week series. The personal narrative series is usually followed by the Reading Spaces series and then the Rhetorical Analysis of Generative AI series.</p>


    <h2>Invention Writing #3: Examples of “Home”</h2>
    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Rhetorical Knowledge, Writing Processes, and Reflective Practice</p>
    <h3>Activities</h3>
    <ol class="skipline">
        <li>Return to your <a href="https://aiteaching.vt.domains/sample-assignments/by-cohort-members/project-one-week-two/">previous invention writing</a>.</li>

        <li>Choose three components of &ldquo;home&rdquo; that you or generative AI provided&mdash;for example, in the kitchen there may be community and tension, or in the bedroom, there may be frustration and success.</li>

        <li>In Copilot, use the following prompt to get assistance from generative AI in thinking about types of examples you could use to develop your personal narrative:
            <blockquote>You are a first-year college student developing an essay on the meaning of home. Create a list of 5 example prompts for finding examples that express _________, ______, and _______. (In the blanks, provide the specific components from the previous bullet point.)</blockquote>
        </li>

        <li>Choose one or more of the suggested prompts and develop at least three paragraphs. Provide specific examples, descriptions, settings, characters, and other information that will provide the audience with a deeper understanding of your definition of &ldquo;home.&rdquo;

            <ul>
                <li>Basically, create a simple rough draft paragraph of that key point to develop further in your project.</li>
                <li>As you set the scene, try to craft the writing so it illuminates the purpose and central meaning you have considered about definition of &ldquo;home.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>You will need to reflect on your experiences, your engagements with people and larger ideas/issues, and your understanding of specific concepts related to &ldquo;home.&rdquo;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For your weekly submission, include these items:
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li>A copy of the generative AI content (your prompt and the 5 prompts Copilot generated). Please highlight the prompts from Copilot you chose.</li>
                <li>At least three paragraphs of YOU responding to a prompt that develops a specific example.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>In-class Activity: Write-Pair-Share Activity</h2>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Rhetorical Knowledge, Writing Processes, and Reflective Practice</p>


    <h3>Activities</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For 5 minutes, I would like you to work on Week Three&rsquo;s Invention Writing. Share your draft with a partner, using the following questions to provide feedback:
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li>How can the writer provide a clearer picture of the example?</li>
                <li>Could they use dialogue instead of summary/paraphrase? Where and possibly how much? (Be specific)</li>
                <li>Could they use more descriptive language to appeal to the reader&rsquo;s senses of logic, credibility, and emotion? Where? (Be specific)</li>
                <li>Are there other things as a reader you would like to &ldquo;see&rdquo; to fully understand the importance of the example? (Be specific)</li>
                <li>When reading your partner&rsquo;s draft, do you get a clear understanding of the point the example will support? Do you get an understanding of the thesis/controlling idea of the essay?</li>
                <li>What suggestions do you have to help your partner illustrate the key points and thesis of their essay more effectively to their audience?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Afterward, go to Copilot and use the following prompt and a copy of a drafted paragraph:
            <blockquote>You are a sympathetic and helpful writing tutor. In the paragraph below, provide three ways I can strengthen the reader&rsquo;s engagement with the writing. Keep compare the AI&rsquo;s suggestions to the insight your partner provided. Make revisions accordingly.</blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>In-class Activity: Understanding Audience</h2>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Rhetorical Knowledge, Writing Processes, and Reflective Practice</p>

    <h3>Activities</h3>

    <ol class="skipline">
        <li>
            Let&rsquo;s take a minute and think about audience:
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li>Who would be interested in your story and definition/s of literacy based on certain adopted identities?</li>
                <li>Why should this group care to learn about this topic from your perspective?</li>
                <li>What ways could you best reach them?</li>
                <li>What tone should you use when writing?</li>
                <li>How do you envision them receiving this communication&mdash;open-minded, skeptical, hostile, etc.?</li>
            </ul>
            Figuring out an intended audience is part of developing a good sense of the rhetorical situation and a key component of the invention stage of the writing process.
        </li>
        <li>Now, let&rsquo;s get some help from generative AI, using the following prompt:
            <blockquote>You are a first-year college student writing a personal narrative essay about your definition of home. Compile a list of 5 potential audiences and the tone the writing should take to reach them.</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>Finally, let&rsquo;s reflect, comparing our list to the generative AI&rsquo;s list:
            <ul>
                <li>What similarities/differences emerge?</li>
                <li>How can you use the AI content to further consider &ldquo;audience&rdquo; in Project One?</li>
                <li>What changes do you need to make to your draft based on your and generative AI&rsquo;s insights?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
