    </ul>

    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> Students share their draft with their peer. Then they read the questions in the higher-order peer review worksheet available to them on Canvas.</li>
        <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> Students complete the peer review worksheet and return it to their peer.</li>
        <li><strong>Part 3 (homework):</strong> Students attach their drafts to an AI tool and then use the following prompt or similar ones to get the feedback of AI on their own draft:
            <p><em>Prompt Example:</em> &ldquo;You are a Peer Reviewer giving feedback on the literacy narrative that I attach/copy... (continues).&rdquo;</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Part 4:</strong> Students carefully read both sets of comments made by their peer and AI. Using these comments, they revise their text which will be the draft of the next peer review workshop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.c. Lower-order peer review workshop</h3>

    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Combining AI-generated feedback with student input to enhance the mechanics of writing, including grammar, punctuation, style, and sentence structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> Students share their revised draft with their peer. Then they read the questions in the lower-order peer review worksheet available to them on Canvas.</li>
        <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> Students complete the peer review worksheet and submit the complete worksheet to AI... (as described).</li>
        <li><strong>Part 3:</strong> Students download the AI response, add it to the peer review worksheet completed by them and then they return them in one single document to their peer.</li>
        <li><strong>Part 4 (homework):</strong> Students carefully read the lower-order and higher-order comments made by both AI and peer. They write a revision plan outlining specific changes they want to make in their draft.</li>
        <li><strong>Part 5:</strong> They respond to a survey asking students to reflect on their experience of working with AI to assist them in revising their texts.</li>
    </ul>
