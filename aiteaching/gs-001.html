    </figure> In education, AI is already being used in various ways, both as an assistant to teachers and as a learning aid for students:</p>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li><strong>AI-powered virtual assistants</strong> can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/blog/2024/01/meet-your-ai-assistant-for-education-microsoft-copilot/">help teachers with administrative tasks</a>, such as <a href="https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/2024/05/09/ai-assisted-grading-a-magic-wand-or-a-pandoras-box/">grading assignments</a> (see also <a href="https://www.lpt.it.miami.edu/resources/faculty-and-staff/leverage-ai-tools/ai-assisted-grading/index.html">grading with GradeScope</a>), <a href="https://hbsp.harvard.edu/inspiring-minds/ai-as-feedback-generator?excludedSlug=ai-as-personal-tutor">providing feedback</a>, and answering students&rsquo; questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive learning platforms</strong> use AI algorithms to personalize the learning experience for each student, adjusting the content and pace based on their individual needs and progress.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-driven tutoring systems</strong> can provide personalized instruction and support, <a href="https://hbsp.harvard.edu/inspiring-minds/ai-as-personal-tutor">acting as virtual tutor for students</a> who need additional help with specific concepts or skills.
        </li>
    </ul>
