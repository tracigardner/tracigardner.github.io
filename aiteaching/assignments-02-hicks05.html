    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>Since the rollout of ChatGPT there has been a great deal of discussion, some might call it a moral panic, about the impact of generative AI on education. Here is a blog post Brett Jones and I wrote on ChatGPT that offered a more positive take: &ldquo;<a href="https://www.civicsoftechnology.org/blog/charting-the-course-incorporating-ai-into-assignments-to-foster-self-regulation">Charting the Course: Incorporating AI Into Assignments to Foster Self-Regulation</a>.&rsquo;</p>

    <p>ChatGPT is not the only AI tool out there&mdash;but it may currently be the most well known in terms of media coverage. The landscape keeps shifting for everyone and so this &ldquo;teacher as researcher&rdquo; assignment is designed to let you explore and investigate how generative AI is shaping or might shape teaching and learning within your discipline for others and yourself.</p>

    <p>For this assignment &ldquo;Teacher as Researcher&rdquo; as a concept refers to the process by which teachers actively engage in research processes to inform, assess, and enhance their instructional practice. This concept embodies a shift from a traditional view of teaching as merely delivering content to a more dynamic role where teachers critically inquire into their pedagogical strategies, student learning, curricular content within the contexts within which they work.</p>

    <p>The teacher as researcher paradigm emphasizes the use of evidence to inform instructional decisions. This evidence may be derived from both quantitative and qualitative research conducted within the classroom, the school, or even larger educational contexts. Engaging in this type of research fosters reflective practice, where teachers critically analyze their instructional methods and student outcomes. Reflection leads to refinement and innovation in teaching strategies, aligning more closely with student needs and contextual factors. The research undertaken by teachers is not separate from their daily teaching but is integrated into their curriculum and pedagogy. It becomes a means of ongoing professional learning that directly impacts classroom practice.</p>

    <p>So, what might this look like for you in this assignment: well to be honest I am not really sure what you will find as we really are on the bleeding edge of the ways generative AI, like ChatGPT, might shape and be shaped by teachers and students through the contexts and disciplines within which they teach and learn. But the goal of this assignment is for you to meet the following objectives by answering the following overarching questions:</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Examine and reflect on current usage of AI within personal, professional, and school contexts within which you are placed</li>
        <li>Develop and Reflect on practical strategies for using AI to enhance your practice as a professional educator</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Guiding Questions</h2>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>How are teachers and possibly students in my placement school currently utilizing AI technologies in the teaching and learning of History and Social Studies Education (HSSE)/English Language Arts (ELA)?</li>
        <li>How can I as a teacher learn to use or not use AI to support my teaching and student learning? What are the potential and provisos of using specific AI platforms to support teaching and learning within my field?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methodology and Reporting</h2>

    <h3>Question 1: Current Utilization of AI in Teaching and Learning</h3>
    <p><strong>Guiding Question:</strong> How are teachers and possibly students in my placement school currently utilizing AI technologies in the teaching and learning of HSSE/ELA?</p>

    <h4>Rationale</h4>
    <p>This question is designed to help you develop some contextual/background information about what teachers and possibly students within your school placement know about the use of AI.</p>

    <h4>Data Collection</h4>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>AI Awareness and Usage survey/interview</li>
        <li>Discuss/interview your CT and possibly students to understand their knowledge, perspectives, and usage of AI. Collect examples of use if possible.</li>
        <li>Locate and analyze the school division&rsquo;s policy on AI</li>
        <li>Compile a personal reflection/memo based on your CT and student&rsquo;s own understanding and utilization of AI.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sub-Questions to Ask</h4>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>How is the school division you are in responding to generative AI?</li>
        <li>Any district level policies?</li>
        <li>How are your cooperating teachers, if at all, using AI? Do they have examples?</li>
        <li>How did they learn about it?</li>
        <li>Do they have any policies about AI with their students?</li>
        <li>Do they have insights/concerns/appreciation of how their students are using AI?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>The key here is to have a discussion with your CT about their understanding of and familiarity with AI. Learn how, if at all, they are using it to support teaching and learning, and to what extent they know anything about how their students are using it. If possible, it might be interesting to see if you can learn from your students and find out what they know about AI (chat) and the ways they are using it in general but also in school. Can you learn about how students are using it in real life.</p>

    <p>Look to capture their stories, insights, and examples. If possible, record your CT or just take detailed notes and memos and see if they have examples of how they are using AI to share with you. Then use what you learn to answer the first question. Provide a nice detailed case that answers the question.</p>

    <h3>Question 2: Personal Exploration and Experimentation with AI</h3>
    <p><strong>Guiding Question:</strong> How can I as a teacher learn to use or not use AI to support my teaching and student learning? What are the potential and provisos of using specific AI platforms to support teaching and learning?</p>

    <h4>Rationale</h4>
    <p>This question is asking you to begin to (1) experiment with AI tools (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, DALLÂ·E, etc.); (2) document your ideas and approaches (procedures/prompts) and (3) critically evaluate/analyze the outcomes and products produced in terms of how well they support the teaching and learning of your subject.</p>

    <h4>Data Collection</h4>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li><strong>Reflect on Current Uses of AI:</strong> Reflect on your own current uses of AI as a student and preservice teacher. Create an inventory of examples of how you have used AI in various contexts.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with AI Tools:</strong> Experiment with at least 3 AI tools. Document the process, outcomes, and reflections.</li>
        <li><strong>Develop and Iterate Prompts:</strong> Map the outputs and critically analyze the effectiveness, ethics, and potential drawbacks of using AI tools in education.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sub-Questions</h4>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>What do you know about AI? Where did you learn about it? How have you used it?</li>
        <li>What ideas do you have for its use to help you teach and support student learning in your discipline?</li>
        <li>Create an inventory of ideas and prompts, then experiment using AI to see what emerges.</li>
        <li>Focus on what you are evaluating and how you will evaluate your products and then share.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>The key here is to play and experiment&mdash;map out a plan of action before you start, then as you play and iterate record (screenshots and notes) each of your activities so you can revisit and reflect on them as you look back over your exploration.</p>

    <h3>3. Creative / Multimodal Report/Product</h3>
    <p>Produce a creative report or product that traces the exploration, experimentation, and findings.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> A combination of a paper/blog post and multimedia presentation/screencast.</p>
    <p>Please provide a brief proposal/outline for your final product to be approved by the instructor before doing your report.</p>

    <h2>Measure of Success / Rubric</h2>
    <p>In terms of outcomes for this Teacher as Researcher project and a rubric. Research can take different forms and different opportunities, or stumbling blocks can occur. So, I think the best path forward is for individual discussions as to your plans and then how your data collection and experimentation is going through the semester. This way we can individualize what the concept of success will look like.</p>

    <p>However, if you need an idealized initial rubric/checklist that helps capture the key criteria for success see below:</p>
