            On this page, and possibly the page of asgts by cohort, I want to add annotations<br><br>
            Page name probably needs to change as these are not all links to collections<br><br>
            And the annotations need to be parallel, which they are not (but I do not care right now)<br><br>
            Testing a table layout in the collections section</p>
