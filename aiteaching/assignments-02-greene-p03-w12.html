    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Rhetorical Knowledge, Writing Processes, and Genre Conventions</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p> To identify and analyze the use of rhetorical concepts (logos, pathos, ethos, kairos, and exigence) and elements of the rhetorical situation (purpose, audience, writer, and context) in ONE of the Two Articles and AI Rhetorical Analysis.</p>

    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>Remember, the goal of this assignment is not just to identify these rhetorical concepts, but to think critically about how they&rsquo;re used in the document to persuade the audience. Happy analyzing!</p>
    <ol class="skipline">
        <li><strong>Reading:</strong> Begin by reading ONE of the Two Articles and AI Rhetorical Analysis. As you read, take notes on instances where you see the rhetorical concepts of logos, pathos, ethos, Kairos, and exigence being used.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Assistance:</strong> Use a generative AI tool (Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot) to help you identify these elements. You can do this by inputting sentences or paragraphs from the document and asking the AI to identify which rhetorical concepts are being used.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Write a short essay (1&ndash;2 pages) analyzing how these rhetorical concepts and elements of the rhetorical situation are used in the document. Be sure to include specific examples from the text to support your analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Finally, write a brief reflection (1&ndash;2 paragraphs) on how using generative AI helped (or didn&rsquo;t help) you in this process. What did you learn from using AI in this way?</li>

        <li><strong>Weekly Submission:</strong> Turn in the following items:
            <ul class="null">
                <li>Your thesis, introduction, and body paragraph.</li>
                <li>Your reflection paragraph.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
