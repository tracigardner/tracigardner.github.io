    <p>Assignment created by Justin Greene (Department of English), with Copilot</p>
    <h2>Exemplification, Explication, Analysis, and Argument</h2>

    <p>This assignment is based on the document&rsquo;s use of logical arguments (logos), emotional appeals (pathos), ethical credibility (ethos), and timeliness (kairos) to discuss the negative impact of AI-generated art on professional artists. Please refer to the document for more details.</p>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Rhetorical Knowledge, Writing Processes, and Genre Conventions</p>

    <h3>Prompt</h3>
    <p>You are a college English instructor teaching first-year writing, and you need to create a short, informal writing assignment that helps students gather evidence, begin rhetorically analyzing, and creating an argument on the attached PDF. The activity should integrate generative AI into the students' work. Students should produce content that focuses on finding evidence of the following rhetorical concepts: logos, pathos, ethos, kairos, and exigence. Also, students should try to identify elements of the rhetorical situation: purpose, audience, writer, and context. Suggest how they can use generative AI to help them identify elements of the rhetorical situation.</p>

    <h3>Assignment Title: Rhetorical Analysis with AI Assistance</h3>
    <h4>Objective</h4>
    <p> To identify and analyze the use of rhetorical concepts (logos, pathos, ethos, kairos, and exigence) and elements of the rhetorical situation (purpose, audience, writer, and context) in ONE of the Two Articles and AI Rhetorical Analysis.</p>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>

    <ol class="skipline">
        <li><strong>Reading:</strong> Begin by reading ONE of the Two Articles and AI Rhetorical Analysis. As you read, take notes on instances where you see the rhetorical concepts of logos, pathos, ethos, Kairos, and exigence being used.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Assistance:</strong> Use a generative AI tool (Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot) to help you identify these elements. You can do this by inputting sentences or paragraphs from the document and asking the AI to identify which rhetorical concepts are being used.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Write a short essay (1&ndash;2 pages) analyzing how these rhetorical concepts and elements of the rhetorical situation are used in the document. Be sure to include specific examples from the text to support your analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Finally, write a brief reflection (1&ndash;2 paragraphs) on how using generative AI helped (or didn&rsquo;t help) you in this process. What did you learn from using AI in this way?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Remember, the goal of this assignment is not just to identify these rhetorical concepts, but to think critically about how they&rsquo;re used in the document to persuade the audience. Happy analyzing!</p>
