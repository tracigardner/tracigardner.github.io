    <p>Assignment created by David Hicks (School of Education), using prompts with Claude AI</p>
    <h2>Assignment: Exploring the Ethical and Creative Uses of Generative AI</h2>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>To critically examine and understand the ethical implications and creative potentials of generative AI in academic work. This includes exploring academic integrity, access and privilege, representation of knowledge, environmental impacts, and other ethical considerations.</p>

    <h3>Part 1: Personal Reflection and Examination</h3>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>Write a reflective essay (1000&ndash;1500 words) addressing the following questions. Be sure to draw on your personal experiences and prior knowledge of academic ethics.</p>

    <h5>Understanding Academic Ethics</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>What does academic integrity mean to you? How have you practiced it in your academic work?</li>
        <li>Describe any experiences you&rsquo;ve had with ethical dilemmas in your academic journey. How did you resolve them?</li>
        <li>Where did you learn about academic integrity?</li>
        <li>What are the most important ethics rules to live by for yourself as a student?</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Generative AI and Ethics</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>How do you perceive the role of AI in academic work? What potential ethical challenges do you foresee?</li>
        <li>Reflect on your understanding of using AI tools in academic settings. What concerns do you have regarding academic integrity when using AI?</li>
        <li>Does your use (actual or intended) of AI tools open up questions about ethics and integrity? How so?</li>
        <li>How do these VT guidelines support or push against your own initial ideas about research and ethics using AI: <a href="https://www.research.vt.edu/research-support/forms-guidance/sirc/guidance-using-artificial-intelligence-during-research-activities.html">VT AI Research Guidance</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Part 2: Interacting with AI Tools</h3>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>Select three different AI chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Bing AI, Bard). Ask each bot the following questions and document their responses. Analyze the similarities and differences in their answers.</p>

    <h5>Ethics and Integrity</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the ethical considerations when using AI in academic work?</li>
        <li>Can AI tools be used to cheat in academic settings? If so, how can this be prevented?</li>
        <li>What are the gray areas in using AI for academic purposes? How should they be navigated?</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Access and Privilege</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>How accessible are AI tools to students from different socioeconomic backgrounds?</li>
        <li>What privileges exist in accessing and using AI tools in academic settings?</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Knowledge Representation</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>How do AI models ensure the representation of diverse knowledge systems, including indigenous knowledge?</li>
        <li>What biases exist in the training data of AI models? How can these biases be mitigated?</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Environmental Impact</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the environmental impact of running AI servers and data centers?</li>
        <li>How can the environmental footprint of AI be reduced?</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Analysis</h5>
    <p>Write a comparative analysis (1000 words) based on the AI responses. Highlight key ethical issues, potential biases, and your thoughts on the integrity of AI-generated information.</p>

    <h3>Part 3: Case Studies and Discussions</h3>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>Read the following case studies and prepare to discuss them in class. For each case study, consider the ethical implications, possible solutions, and your stance on the issue.</p>

    <h5>Case Study 1: Misrepresentation of Information</h5>
    <p>A student uses an AI tool to generate a research paper but finds that the AI has fabricated sources and data. Discuss the ethical issues and how the student should handle this situation.</p>

    <h5>Case Study 2: Access and Privilege</h5>
    <p>In a resource-limited school, only a few students have access to advanced AI tools. Discuss the ethical implications of this disparity and propose potential solutions to ensure equitable access.</p>

    <h5>Case Study 3: Environmental Impact</h5>
    <p>A university decides to incorporate AI tools extensively in their curriculum. Discuss the potential environmental impacts and suggest ways to minimize the carbon footprint of these tools.</p>

    <h5>Class Discussion</h5>
    <p>Participate in a group discussion, sharing your insights and solutions for each case study. Prepare a short presentation (5&ndash;7 minutes) on your group&rsquo;s findings.</p>

    <h3>Part 4: Final Reflection and Creative Exploration</h3>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>Write a final reflection (1000 words) summarizing your learning from the assignment. Address the following points:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your evolved understanding of academic ethics in the context of AI.</li>
        <li>The most surprising insights gained from interacting with AI tools and discussing case studies.</li>
        <li>How you plan to ethically and creatively use AI in your future academic work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Creative Exploration</h5>
    <p>Create a visual representation (e.g., infographic, poster, video) that captures the key ethical considerations and creative potentials of generative AI. Be prepared to share and explain your creation in class.</p>
