                <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Participation in hands-on exercises with AI tools.<br>
                    Example Prompt and Output:</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p style="margin-top: 9px;">Prompt: Write a short story about a hero overcoming an obstacle.</p>
                        <p>Output: Once upon a time, in a land far away, a young hero named Aria faced a formidable dragon. Despite the odds, Aria&rsquo;s bravery and intelligence led to the dragon&rsquo;s defeat, bringing peace to the kingdom.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prompt Engineering Assignment:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Develop a set of prompts to achieve specific goals (e.g., generate creative content, solve a problem).</li>
                <li>Use the AI tool to generate outputs based on your prompts.</li>
                <li>Submit the prompts and generated outputs.</li>
                <li>Assessment: Evaluated on clarity, effectiveness, and creativity. <br>Example Prompts and Outputs:
                    <blockquote>
                        <p style="margin-top: 9px;">Prompt: Generate a marketing tagline for a new eco-friendly product.</p>
                        <p>Output: Sustainable Solutions for a Greener Tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>Prompt: Summarize the main points of an article on climate change.</p>
                        <p>Output: Climate change is a pressing global issue, driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Key points include rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and the need for renewable energy sources.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Example Prompts and Responses</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 9px;">Prompt 1</h3>
        <p>Generate a marketing tagline for a new eco-friendly product.</p>

        <h3>Output 1</h3>
        <p>Sustainable Solutions for a Greener Tomorrow.</p>

        <h3>Prompt 2</h3>
        <p>Summarize the main points of an article on climate change.</p>

        <h3>Output 2</h3>
        <p>Climate change is a pressing global issue, driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Key points include rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and the need for renewable energy sources.</p>

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>The first prompt aimed to create a concise and impactful marketing tagline for an eco-friendly product. The generated output effectively conveys the product&rsquo;s environmental focus and future-oriented benefits, making it suitable for promotional materials. The second prompt sought to summarize an article on climate change. The output provides a clear and accurate summary of the key points, demonstrating the AI&rsquo;s ability to condense complex information into a digestible format.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>This exercise highlights the importance of crafting precise and clear prompts to guide AI-generated content. Effective prompt engineering requires understanding the desired outcome and providing sufficient context for the AI to generate relevant responses. Through practice, one can develop the skills to create prompts that yield high-quality outputs, enhancing the utility of AI tools in various applications.</p>
