    <h3>Peer Review activity<br>
        (50 min./class following previous review)</h3>

    <h4>Instructions for Peer Reviewers</h4>
    <p>As you review your peer&rsquo;s essay, remember to be an empathetic reader. Your goal is to provide constructive feedback that will help your classmate improve their essay. Be specific and descriptive in your suggestions for revision. Focus on the following areas in order:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Global Concerns</li>
        <li>Paragraph-Level Concerns</li>
        <li>Sentence-Level Concerns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For each section, answer the questions thoughtfully and provide examples from the essay to support your feedback.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h5>Global Concerns</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Does the essay have a clear and analytical thesis statement about the meaning of &ldquo;reading&rdquo; and the importance of the chosen space for reading? If yes, what is it? If not, what suggestions do you have for developing one?</li>
            <li>How effectively does the essay explore the concept of &ldquo;reading&rdquo; beyond traditional text-based reading? Are there any aspects of reading in the chosen space that could be further developed?</li>
            <li>Does the essay effectively integrate descriptions of the photographs with the written analysis? How might this integration be improved?</li>
            <li>Is the overall structure of the essay clear and logical? Does it effectively guide the reader through the author&rsquo;s argument? If not, what suggestions do you have for improving the organization?</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Paragraph-Level Concerns</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Do individual paragraphs have clear topic sentences that relate to the overall thesis? Provide an example of a strong topic sentence or suggest improvements for a weak one.</li>
            <li>How well does each paragraph develop its main idea? Are there any paragraphs that need more evidence or explanation?</li>
            <li>Are transitions between paragraphs smooth and logical? If not, where could transitions be improved?</li>
            <li>Do the paragraphs effectively balance description of the space and objects with analysis of their significance? If not, which areas need more development?</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Sentence-Level Concerns</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Are there any sentences that are unclear or difficult to understand? If so, which ones, and how might they be clarified?</li>
            <li>How varied is the sentence structure throughout the essay? Are there any areas where sentence variety could be improved?</li>
            <li>Is the language used appropriate for a college-level audience? Are there any instances where more sophisticated vocabulary or phrasing could be used?</li>
            <li>Are there any grammatical or mechanical errors that distract from the content of the essay? If so, what are they and where do they occur?<br><br></li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Reminder to Peer Reviewers</h4>
    <p>When providing feedback, be specific and descriptive. Instead of simply pointing out problems, offer concrete suggestions for improvement. For example, instead of saying &ldquo;This paragraph is weak,&rdquo; you might say &ldquo;The third paragraph could be strengthened by adding an example of how the arrangement of books in the space reflects the author&rsquo;s reading habits.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Remember that the goal of this peer review is to help your classmate improve their essay. Be honest but kind in your feedback, focusing on how the essay can be enhanced rather than criticizing what&rsquo;s already there.</p>

    <p>After completing your review, discuss your feedback with your peer, allowing them to ask questions and clarify any points. This discussion can provide valuable insights for both the writer and the reviewer.</p>
