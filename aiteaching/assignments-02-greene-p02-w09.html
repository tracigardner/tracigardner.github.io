    <h2>Peer Review, Part II:<br>
        Essay Revision with a Classmate
    </h2>

    <p><strong>Class Duration:</strong> 50 minutes</p>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Writing Processes and Reflective Practice</p>

    <h3>Activities</h3>
    <ol class="skipline">
        <li>Read your peer&rsquo;s essay twice. First, read for overall impression and understanding. Second, read for detailed analysis.</li>
        <li>Answer the Peer Review Questions (below) in each section, providing specific and descriptive suggestions for revision. For example, instead of saying &ldquo;This paragraph is weak,&rdquo; you might say &ldquo;The third paragraph could be strengthened by adding an example of how the arrangement of books in the space reflects the author&rsquo;s reading habits.&rdquo;</li>
        <li>Remember to be an empathetic reader. Consider the author&rsquo;s intentions and experiences while offering constructive feedback.</li>

        <li>Remember that the goal of this peer review is to help your classmate improve their essay. Be honest but kind in your feedback, focusing on how the essay can be enhanced rather than criticizing what&rsquo;s already there.</li>

        <li>After completing your review, complete these tasks:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Discuss your feedback with your peer, allowing them to ask questions or seek clarification.</li>
                <li>Write a short reflection (150&ndash;200 words) on how this process of giving feedback might inform your own writing and revision strategies. Compare this peer activity with the generative AI review activity.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>For your weekly submission, include these items:
            <ul class="null">
                <li>Your reflection.</li>
                <li>Your revised revision plan.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Peer Review Questions</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <h4>Global Concerns</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Does the essay have a clear and analytical thesis statement about the meaning of &ldquo;reading&rdquo; and the importance of the chosen space for reading? If yes, what is it? If not, what suggestions do you have for developing one?</li>
            <li>How effectively does the essay explore the concept of &ldquo;reading&rdquo; beyond traditional text-based reading? Are there any aspects of reading in the chosen space that could be further developed?</li>
            <li>Does the essay effectively integrate descriptions of the photographs with the written analysis? How might this integration be improved?</li>
            <li>Is the overall structure of the essay clear and logical? Does it effectively guide the reader through the author&rsquo;s argument? If not, what suggestions do you have for improving the organization?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Paragraph-Level Concerns</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Do individual paragraphs have clear topic sentences that relate to the overall thesis? Provide an example of a strong topic sentence or suggest improvements for a weak one.</li>
            <li>How well does each paragraph develop its main idea? Are there any paragraphs that need more evidence or explanation?</li>
            <li>Are transitions between paragraphs smooth and logical? If not, where could transitions be improved?</li>
            <li>Do the paragraphs effectively balance description of the space and objects with analysis of their significance? If not, which areas need more development?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sentence-Level Concerns</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Are there any sentences that are unclear or difficult to understand? If so, which ones, and how might they be clarified?</li>
            <li>How varied is the sentence structure throughout the essay? Are there any areas where sentence variety could be improved?</li>
            <li>Is the language used appropriate for a college-level audience? Are there any instances where more sophisticated vocabulary or phrasing could be used?</li>
            <li>Are there any grammatical or mechanical errors that distract from the content of the essay? If so, what are they and where do they occur?<br><br></li>
        </ul>
