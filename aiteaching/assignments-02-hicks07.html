    <h3>Title</h3>
    <p><strong>Ethical AI Use in Academia: A Case Study on History and Computer Science</strong></p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This report explores the ethical use of AI by Dr. Jane Smith from the History Department and John Doe, a graduate student in Computer Science. Both individuals utilize AI to advance their research and teaching while addressing ethical considerations such as power, privilege, and environmental impact.</p>

    <h3>Case Study 1: Dr. Jane Smith</h3>
    <p>Dr. Smith integrates AI in her historical research to analyze large datasets of historical texts. Using natural language processing (NLP) tools, she uncovers patterns and trends that were previously inaccessible. Her primary goal is to enhance the understanding of historical narratives and make data-driven interpretations more accessible to students.</p>

    <h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>
    <p>Dr. Smith is aware of the ethical challenges, including the potential bias in historical data and the environmental impact of using large AI models. She mitigates these issues by employing fair data practices and optimizing her computational processes to reduce energy consumption.</p>

    <h3>Case Study 2: John Doe</h3>
    <p>John Doe uses AI in his computer science projects to develop more efficient algorithms for data processing. His research focuses on creating inclusive AI models that consider diverse user needs. John&rsquo;s goal is to improve AI accessibility and ensure that his models do not perpetuate existing biases.</p>

    <h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>
    <p>John addresses ethical concerns by collaborating with diverse communities during the model development process. He also emphasizes transparency in his work, making his algorithms and datasets publicly available for scrutiny and improvement.</p>
