        <p>Embracing the power of AI in the classroom requires careful consideration and clear communication of expectations. As educators, it is crucial to establish guidelines that promote the ethical and responsible use of these powerful tools while upholding the principles of academic integrity.</p>

        <p>One way to achieve this balance is through the inclusion of well-crafted syllabus statements that outline the appropriate use of AI in your course. These statements serve as a foundation for open dialogue, setting clear boundaries and reinforcing the ethical commitments that students must uphold, in accordance with the Virginia Tech Honor Code through both the

        </p>

        <p>By explicitly defining the permitted and prohibited uses of AI, you not only provide transparency but also empower students to leverage these tools responsibly and with integrity. Syllabus statements can address various aspects, such as when and how AI can be utilized for writing assignments, research, or problem-solving tasks, as well as the consequences for misuse or academic dishonesty.</p>

        <p>The pages that follow will guide you through this process. You&rsquo;ll find strategies for aligning AI use with your course goals and disciplinary norms, tips for setting clear expectations and consequences, considerations for supporting equitable and responsible AI use, and suggestions for adapting your policy as technologies and student needs evolve. Together, these resources are designed to help you create AI syllabus statements that are both practical and pedagogically sound.</p>
