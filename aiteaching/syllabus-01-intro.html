    </figure>Embracing the power of AI in the classroom requires careful consideration and clear communication of expectations. As educators, it is crucial to establish guidelines that promote the ethical and responsible use of these powerful tools while upholding the principles of academic integrity.</p>

    <p>One way to achieve this balance is through the inclusion of well-crafted syllabus statements that outline the appropriate use of AI in your course. These statements serve as a foundation for open dialogue, setting clear boundaries and reinforcing the ethical commitments that students must uphold, in accordance with the Virginia Tech Honor Code through both the <a href="https://honorsystem.vt.edu/">Office of Undergraduate Academic Integrity</a> and the <a href="https://graduateschool.vt.edu/academics/expectations/graduate-honor-system.html">Graduate Honor System</a>.</p>

    <p>By explicitly defining the permitted and prohibited uses of AI, you not only provide transparency but also empower students to leverage these tools responsibly and with integrity. Syllabus statements can address various aspects, such as when and how AI can be used for writing assignments, research, or problem-solving tasks, as well as the consequences for misuse or academic dishonesty.</p>

    <p>In the Syllabus Statements section of the site, you&rsquo;ll find these resources:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Strategies for aligning AI use with your course goals and disciplinary norms.</li>
        <li>Tips for setting clear expectations and consequences.</li>
        <li>Considerations for supporting equitable and responsible AI use.</li>
        <li>Suggestions for adapting your policy as technologies and student needs evolve.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Together with the example syllabus policies, these resources can help you create AI syllabus statements that are both practical and pedagogically sound.</p>


    <h3>Syllabus Guidance at Virginia Tech</h3>

    <p>Virginia Tech does not have a university-wide policy for the use of artificial intelligence other than following the guidelines of the university&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.vt.edu/acceptable-use.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. This approach allows you to decide how (or if) you include AI strategies in your classes. Your department, college, or school may have guidance however, so be sure you follow any policies or advice they have.</p>

    <p>You can also consult these university resources for advice on shaping your own syllabus policy:</p>

    <h3>Research Guidance at Virginia Tech</h3>
    <p>Virginia Tech has several documents on research and the use of AI. These guidelines will be useful if your students are using AI while conducting their own research as well as if you are using AI as part of projects on the scholarship of teaching and learning.</p>
    <p>These resources outline guidance for conducting such research projects:</p>
