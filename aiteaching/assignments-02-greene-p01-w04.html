    <h3>Part II (in-class/50 min.)</h3>

    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> you are a first-year writing instructor in an English department at an R1 university. Create a peer review activity for a personal narrative essay. Make sure to have students be empathetic readers looking for global concerns first, paragraph level concerns second, and sentence-level concerns third. Create 4 questions for each area of focus that students can use to provide feedback. Remind students to be specific and descriptive in their suggestions for revision.</p>

    <h4>Output:</h4>
    <h5>Peer Review Activity: Personal Narrative Essay</h5>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To provide constructive feedback on your peer&rsquo;s personal narrative essay, focusing on global concerns, paragraph-level issues, and sentence-level details, while maintaining an empathetic reading approach.</p>

    <h6>Instructions:</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Read your peer&rsquo;s essay twice. First, for overall impression and understanding. Second, for detailed analysis.</li>
        <li>Answer the questions in each section, providing specific and descriptive suggestions for revision.</li>
        <li>Remember to be an empathetic reader. Consider the author&rsquo;s intentions and experiences while offering constructive feedback.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>
        <h6>Global Concerns</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the main theme or message of the narrative? Is it clearly conveyed throughout the essay?</li>
            <li>How effectively does the author establish their unique voice and perspective?</li>
            <li>Does the narrative have a clear beginning, middle, and end? If not, what suggestions can you offer to improve the overall structure?</li>
            <li>How well does the author balance storytelling with reflection? Are there areas where more reflection or more narrative detail would be beneficial?</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Paragraph-Level Concerns</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Do individual paragraphs have clear focuses that contribute to the overall narrative?</li>
            <li>How well does the author transition between paragraphs and ideas?</li>
            <li>Is there a good balance of description, dialogue, and reflection within paragraphs?</li>
            <li>Are there any paragraphs that seem out of place or could be better positioned to improve the flow of the narrative?</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Sentence-Level Concerns</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>How varied are the sentence structures? Are there areas where sentence variety could be improved?</li>
            <li>Does the author effectively use sensory details to bring the narrative to life?</li>
            <li>Is the dialogue (if present) natural and purposeful?</li>
            <li>Are there any instances of unclear or awkward phrasing that could be revised for better clarity or impact?<br><br></li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> When providing feedback, be specific and descriptive in your suggestions for revision. For example, instead of simply stating &ldquo;This paragraph needs work,&rdquo; you might say &ldquo;The third paragraph could be strengthened by adding more sensory details about the setting to help readers visualize the scene.&rdquo;</p>

    <h5>After completing your review:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Discuss your feedback with your peer, allowing them to ask questions or seek clarification.</li>
        <li>Write a short reflection (150&ndash;200 words) on how this process of giving feedback might inform your own writing and revision strategies. Compare this peer activity with the generative AI review activity.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Remember, the goal of this peer review is to help your classmate improve their essay while also developing your own critical reading and writing skills. Approach the task with empathy, considering how you would want to receive feedback on your own personal narrative.</p>
