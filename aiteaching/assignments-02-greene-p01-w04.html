    <p><strong>Class Duration:</strong> 50 minutes</p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>To provide constructive feedback on your peer&rsquo;s personal narrative essay, focusing on global concerns, paragraph-level issues, and sentence-level details, while maintaining an empathetic reading approach.</p>

    <h3>Activities</h3>
    <ol class="skipline">
        <li>Read your peer&rsquo;s essay twice. First, read for overall impression and understanding. Second, read for detailed analysis.</li>
        <li>Answer the Peer Review Questions (below) in each section, providing specific and descriptive suggestions for revision. For example, instead of simply stating &ldquo;This paragraph needs work,&rdquo; you might say &ldquo;The third paragraph could be strengthened by adding more sensory details about the setting to help readers visualize the scene.&rdquo;</li>
        <li>Remember to be an empathetic reader. Consider the author&rsquo;s intentions and experiences while offering constructive feedback.</li>

            <li>How effectively does the author establish their unique voice and perspective?</li>
