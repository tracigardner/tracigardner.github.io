    <h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policies</h2>

    <p class="byline">Policy created by Traci Gardner (Department of English)</p>

    <h2>Does AI matter in this course?</h2> Yes, definitely. You are very likely to use AI in the workplace. 75% of global knowledge workers already use AI, according to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2024-work-trends-index-report-microsoft-linkedin-5y9ee/">2024 Microsoft/LinkedIn study</a>. 66% of employers said that they would not hire someone without AI skills, and 71% said they would hire less-qualified people with AI skills over more-qualified people without them, according to the same study. To prepare for the writing you&rsquo;ll do in the workplace, we&rsquo;ll consider how to use AI to improve your critical thinking and writing.</p>

    <h2>What AI tools can I use?</h2> You can use <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/">Copilot</a> for assignments that require generative AI tasks. Copilot is the only AI tool officially approved by Virginia Tech because it protects your personal work when you login with your VT PID. It will <em>not</em> use any content you upload, so your writing will not be part of the language learning database.</p>

    <p>I will design our activities to be compatible with Copilot to streamline the activities I ask you to complete. You are welcome to use other AI tools that you have access to. If an alternative tool cannot accomplish an assigned task however, you&rsquo;ll need to switch back to Copilot.</p>

    <h2>What can I use AI for in this course?</h2> For each activity, I will provide detailed instructions on how AI can be used. Generally speaking, you can use AI in these ways:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li><strong>Brainstorming Ideas:</strong> You can ask Copilot to generate a list of topics that interest you by creating a prompt that includes the assignment parameters. Next, use AI to help you evaluate the list for the most promising ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Editing Checks:</strong> Have AI check your draft for accuracy. Copilot can check for basic grammatical mistakes, punctuation errors, and spelling issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Research Assistance:</strong> Ask AI to help you research a topic. Copilot can help you find relevant sources and gather information. However, it&rsquo;s crucial to verify the accuracy and credibility of the sources and information that Copilot suggests. Always cross-check with reliable references.</li>
        <li><strong>Draft Review:</strong> AI can be used ethically for draft reviewing. You can think of AI as a computer peer review partner. I&rsquo;ll provide instructions for these tasks. I&rsquo;ll ask you to try some of the following AI tasks as you work on drafts:
            <ul>
                <li>Develop ideas: AI can help expand on initial ideas, providing additional perspectives or angles that you might not have considered. Use it to deepen your understanding of a topic and develop a more comprehensive approach.</li>
                <li>Outline and Organize: Copilot can create outlines and organize your thoughts. Input your main points and ask AI to suggest a logical structure or flow for your document.</li>
                <li>Summarize: You can use AI to summarize content. This can save time and help you focus on the most critical information.</li>
                <li>Check Document Design: Use Copilot to review design elements like layout, use of white space, font choices, and overall design effectiveness. AI can then suggest improvements to enhance readability and aesthetic appeal.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What if I want to use Copilot in a way you haven&rsquo;t mentioned?</h2> If you have an idea for using AI in a way I haven&rsquo;t mentioned, send me a message in Canvas explaining your plan and how it relates to use of AI in the workplace. I&rsquo;ll review your request and let you know if it&rsquo;s acceptable.</p>

    <h2>Are there things I can&rsquo;t use AI for?</h2> For most of the work in this course, you cannot ask AI to write or revise your drafts or final submissions for you. Doing so directly violates the <a href="https://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/">Cheating and Plagiarism sections of the Virginia Tech Honor Code</a>.</p>

    <p>There will be some exceptions, such as asking Zoom&rsquo;s AI to generate a first draft of group meeting minutes. I&rsquo;ll be clear about these exceptions in the assignments.</p>

    <h2>What if Copilot gives me incorrect information or makes other mistakes?</h2> Regardless of how or where you use AI in this course, you are fully responsible for the work you submit. Just as in the workplace, you need to stand behind your work. If AI introduces errors and you pass them along, you are accountable for those mistakes. The goal here is not to discourage you from using AI but to help you develop the critical skill of verifying AI-generated content&mdash;an essential practice in any professional setting.</p>

    <h2>What do I need to keep track of when I use AI?</h2> Keep track of what AI tools you used and how you used them. In some cases, the assignment will ask you to save specific artifacts, like the prompt that you used and the response that the AI tool gave you. Always read the assignment carefully to determine the information you need to track as you use AI.</p>

    <h2>How do I need to acknowledge my use of AI?</h2> When you use AI as you work on your assignments, include details on which AI tools you used and how they contributed to your work in a <a href="#">submission comment</a> when you submit your work.</p>

    <h2>Any tips?</h2> While I encourage you to use AI in this course, be aware that other professors may have different policies regarding AI. Always check the AI use policy for each of your courses to ensure you comply with their expectations.</p>
