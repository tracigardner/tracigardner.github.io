    <p class="series-overview">This assignment is the fifth week of a five-week series, usually used during the tenth week of the term. The Reading Spaces series is usually preceded by the Personal Narrative series and then the Rhetorical Analysis of Generative AI series.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>These questions encourage students to reflect on their application of course concepts, their engagement with the writing process, and their personal growth through the project.</p>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Reflective Practice</p>

    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Use the following questions to reflect on your writing process and your use of Generative AI on this project. As you work, think about how AI tools might influence your writing strategies, rhetorical choices, and overall learning experience:</p>
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li><strong>Rhetorical Knowledge:</strong> How did your choice of photographs and captions in your photo essay help communicate your message about your reading space to your audience of peers? What specific rhetorical choices did you make? If applicable, how did generative AI assist you in developing your rhetorical knowledge?</li>
                <li><strong>Genre Conventions:</strong> In what ways did you adhere to or creatively adapt the conventions of a photo essay? How did understanding this genre impact your approach to the project? If applicable, how did generative AI assist you in understanding the photo essay genre?</li>
                <li><strong>Writing Processes:</strong> Describe your writing process for this project, from invention to final draft. How did the weekly draft materials and invention writings contribute to the development of your ideas? If applicable, how did generative AI assist you in your writing process?</li>
                <li><strong>Multimodal Transformation:</strong> How did combining text with images allow you to communicate ideas that might have been difficult to express through text alone? Can you provide a specific example from your essay? If applicable, how did generative AI assist you in understanding the value of communicating in multiple modes?</li>
                <li><strong>Reflective Practice:</strong> Looking back at your completed photo essay, what did you learn about your own reading habits and spaces? How has this project changed your understanding of what &ldquo;reading&rdquo; can mean? If applicable, what benefits/issues did generative AI add to your completed project?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
