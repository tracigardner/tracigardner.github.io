    <p>Creating effective AI policies starts with a clear understanding of what your course is designed to teach. Because AI tools can influence how students read, write, solve problems, and conduct research, the way you permit or limit their use should be guided by your course&rsquo;s learning outcomes and core values.</p>

    <h3>Start with Your Learning Goals</h3>

    <p>Ask yourself:</p>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>What are the essential skills or habits of mind students should develop in this course?</li>
        <li>Which assignments or activities are most central to those goals?</li>
        <li>How might AI use support or interfere with students&rsquo; learning?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your syllabus policy should reflect how AI impacts student development of key learning outcomes. Here are some examples to consider:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>You might allow AI tools for code debugging or problem brainstorming, but require students to explain their design logic or submit original implementations to demonstrate understanding.</li>

        <li>AI might be helpful for summarizing complex literature or assisting with study aids&mdash;but not for completing lab reports, diagnostic reasoning tasks, or assessments where recall and critical thinking are essential.</li>

        <li>Students might use AI to draft outreach materials or policy briefs, while data interpretation and research design require original analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The goal isn&rsquo;t simply to allow or ban AI, but to define how it fits within the skills and habits you are teaching and when its use may bypass essential learning in the course.</p>

    <h3>Consider the Role of AI in Your Discipline</h3>

    <p>AI use is not one-size-fits-all. Different fields hold different assumptions about authorship, originality, collaboration, and tool use. As you shape your policy, consider how your discipline or the professional paths your students are preparing for already makes use of (or places limits on) emerging technologies.</p>

    <p>These examples demonstrate differences between disciplinary use and the learning objectives for the course:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Using AI for drafting code, running simulations, or interpreting results may reflect real-world practices, but you likely still want to ensure that students demonstrate conceptual understanding and the ability to troubleshoot or explain their work.</li>

        <li>AI might assist in synthesizing documents, modeling environmental data, or supporting writing. Still, activities like hypothesis generation, lab documentation, or field study design may require more stringent boundaries.</li>

        <li>Your discipline or course may focus on original analysis, critical interpretation, and voice. In that situation, AI might be used to support revision or idea generation, but you might prohibit its use for generating content or citing sources since those are the skills students are learning.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>You don&rsquo;t need to anticipate every tool or scenario, but your policy should reflect the values, norms, and skill development priorities of your field. You may also wish to consider disciplinary guidelines, accreditation expectations, or professional codes of ethics when drafting your statement.</p>

    <h3>Identify Use Cases That Support Learning</h3>

    <p>Rather than treating AI use as an all-or-nothing issue, it can help to define specific scenarios where AI use is permitted, encouraged, restricted, or prohibited. Think about discrete ways AI can be used, breaking up tasks into subtasks and determining whether or how AI might be appropriate. Questions like these can guide your decisionmaking:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Can students use AI to brainstorm ideas, generate outlines, or revise drafts?</li>

        <li>Is AI allowed during in-class work, take-home assignments, or exams?</li>

        <li>Are there parts of the assignment that must be completed without assistance?</li>

        <li>How should students document or reflect on their AI use?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These distinctions can help students use AI tools with intention and respect for your course goals. The more specific and context-based your policy is, the more likely students are to understand and follow it.</p>

    <h3>Write a Policy That Aligns with Your Goals</h3>

    <p>As you pull these ideas together, use the following prompts to help you write a values-aligned syllabus statement:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>What should students be able to do independently by the end of the course?</li>

        <li>Where might AI use enhance learning, and where might it shortcut it?</li>

        <li>What habits of ethical or critical tool use do you want students to develop?</li>

        <li>How will your policy help students meet course outcomes?</li>

        <li>How will you explain the policy in ways that are meaningful and accessible to your students?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Ultimately, your AI policy should reflect the goals, values, and disciplinary expectations that shape your course. By grounding your guidance in your learning outcomes, clearly defining appropriate use cases, and considering how AI fits within your field, you can help students make informed, ethical decisions about when and how to use these tools. This kind of thoughtful alignment lays the groundwork for clear communication and academic integrity throughout the semester.</p>
