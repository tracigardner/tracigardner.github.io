    <h2>Project One: Definitional Personal Narrative on the Concept &ldquo;Home&rdquo;</h2>

    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <h4>Invention writing #1: Brainstorming, Comparison, and Reflection for Project One Topic</h4>
    <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Writing Processes and Reflective Practice<br>
        On a sheet of paper, the same document you drafted your introduction on Monday, or a new Word/Google Doc, create a list using the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What characteristics does &ldquo;home&rdquo; hold?</li>
        <li>How have you developed/come to know these characteristics?</li>
        <li>Why is &quot;home&quot; a fluid concept&mdash;one that changes with a person's identities, experiences, age, location, peers/family, etc.?</li>
        <li>If you can&rsquo;t think of anything, just write gibberish of the same word over until something pops into your brain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Next, go to Microsoft Copilot or ChatGPT. Modify the following prompt to give the AI a role | task | format: You are a first-year college student away from home for the first time and are tasked with brainstorming on the concept of &ldquo;home.&rdquo; Generate a list of 10 characteristics about the concept &ldquo;home&rdquo; that could be expanded into a 1000-word essay.</p>
    <p>After the AI has created its list, compare the output to your list and reflect on the similarities and differences: What ideas interest you between the two lists? How can you expand upon things that you and/or AI created? Why could using AI to help you &ldquo;think&rdquo; be useful? What issues could arise by using AI in the invention stage of the writing process?</p>

    <h4>Weekly submission:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Your list</li>
        <li>Your prompt for generative AI (if applicable)</li>
        <li>The generative AI output (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Your reflection</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>In-Class Activity: Discussion of article and &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for writing</h4>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> You are an English instructor teaching first year students in freshman composition. Devise a groupwork activity where students need to summarize the attached pdf, create 3 writing rules all young writers should follow, and 3 writing rules all young writers should not follow. Integrate generative ai in at least one component of the activity. (PDF of E. Shelley Reid, &ldquo;Ten Ways to Think About Writing&hellip;&rdquo;)</p>
    <p><strong>Follow up:</strong> Can you revise the activity above to take place over a 50-minute class with at least 10 minutes for reflection at the end of the activity</p>

    <h4>Revised Groupwork Activity: &ldquo;AI-Enhanced Writing Exploration&rdquo;</h4>
    <p><strong>Class Duration:</strong> 50 minutes</p>

    <p><strong>Activity Breakdown:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Introduction (5 minutes):</strong><br>
            Briefly introduce the essay &ldquo;Ten Ways To Think About Writing: Metaphoric Musings for College Writing Students&rdquo; and the day&rsquo;s objectives.</li>

        <li><strong>Summarization Relay (15 minutes):</strong><br>
            Divide students into groups of 4-5.<br>
            Assign each group a different section of the essay&rsquo;s summary.<br>
            Groups read, discuss, and prepare to present the main points of their section.</li>

        <li><strong>Writing Rules Workshop (10 minutes):</strong><br>
            Groups brainstorm to create &lsquo;Do&rsquo; and &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t&rsquo; writing rules based on the essay.<br>
            Select three &lsquo;Do&rsquo; Rules that are encouraged and three &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t&rsquo; Rules to avoid.</li>

        <li><strong>Generative AI Integration (5 minutes):</strong><br>
            Introduce the generative AI tool (like Copilot) to the class.<br>
            Each group inputs one &lsquo;Do&rsquo; Rule into the AI to generate a positive writing example.</li>

        <li><strong>Group Presentations (5 minutes):</strong><br>
            Groups take turns presenting their &lsquo;Do&rsquo; and &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t&rsquo; Rules.<br>
            Share the AI-generated example for their &lsquo;Do&rsquo; Rule.</li>

        <li><strong>Class Discussion (5 minutes):</strong><br>
            Discuss the presented rules and AI examples.<br>
            Highlight the importance of understanding and applying writing principles.</li>

        <li><strong>Reflection (10 minutes):</strong><br>
            Students individually write a short reflection on how AI can assist in learning writing skills.<br>
            <em>Prompt: &ldquo;How can generative AI serve as a tool for enhancing our understanding and practice of writing?&rdquo;</em>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note for Instructor:</strong><br>
        Ensure that each group has access to the AI tool and understands how to use it.<br>
        Facilitate the discussion by asking probing questions and encouraging critical thinking.<br>
        During the reflection period, circulate the room to offer guidance and answer any questions.<br>
        This revised schedule ensures that each component of the activity is given adequate time, while also allowing students to reflect on their learning experience with generative AI in writing.</p>

    <h4>In-Class Activity: Write-Pair-Share</h4>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> I am teaching first year college students in a freshman composition class, and I would like to design a write-pair-share activity that lasts 30 minutes on the topic of home. Create write-pair-share activity.</p>
    <p><strong>Follow up:</strong> This is good. Can you integrate the use of generative ai into this activity</p>

    <h4>Activity Title: Navigating Home and Literacy with Generative AI</h4>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To utilize generative AI as a tool for enhancing the exploration of &ldquo;home&rdquo; and literacy concepts, fostering creativity, and encouraging critical engagement with AI-generated content.</p>

    <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to a generative AI platform (ensure all students have access)</li>
        <li>Writing materials</li>
        <li>Timer or stopwatch</li>
        <li>Space for pairs to discuss</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Activity Outline:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduction to Generative AI (5 minutes)</strong><br>
            Introduce the concept of generative AI and its capabilities in creating text-based content.<br>
            Explain how AI can be used as a tool to generate ideas, prompts, and even challenge our thinking.</li>

        <li><strong>AI-Assisted Freewriting (10 minutes)</strong><br>
            Provide each student with a unique prompt generated by AI related to the concept of &ldquo;home&rdquo; and literacy.<br>
            Set a timer for 10 minutes and ask students to freewrite their responses, incorporating or reacting to the AI-generated content.</li>

        <li><strong>Pairing and AI Interaction (5 minutes)</strong><br>
            Have students form pairs and share their AI-generated prompts and freewriting responses.<br>
            Each pair should use the AI to generate a new piece of content that combines elements from both students&rsquo; writings.</li>

        <li><strong>Discussion and Critical Analysis (5 minutes)</strong><br>
            Instruct pairs to discuss the AI-generated content: What surprised them? What seemed accurate or inaccurate?<br>
            Encourage them to critically analyze the role of AI in understanding complex human concepts like &ldquo;home&rdquo; and literacy.</li>

        <li><strong>Share and Reflect (5 minutes)</strong><br>
            Reconvene as a class and have a few pairs share their AI-generated content and insights.<br>
            Discuss the potential and limitations of using AI in creative and reflective writing.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Closure:</strong><br>
        Summarize the discussions and reflect on how generative AI can be both a creative tool and a subject for critical thinking.</p>

    <p><strong>Follow-Up:</strong><br>
        Assign a reflective essay on the experience of interacting with generative AI and its impact on their understanding of the session&rsquo;s topics.</p>

    <p>By integrating generative AI into the activity, students not only engage with the concepts of &ldquo;home&rdquo; and literacy but also gain firsthand experience with the emerging technology, fostering a deeper understanding of its influence on communication and creativity.</p>
