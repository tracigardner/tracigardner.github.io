    <h3>Activities</h3>
    <ol class="skipline">
        <li>
            On a sheet of paper, the same document you drafted your introduction, or a new Word/Google Doc, create a list using the following questions:
            <ul>
                <li>What characteristics does &ldquo;home&rdquo; hold?</li>
                <li>How have you developed/come to know these characteristics?</li>
                <li>Why is &quot;home&quot; a fluid concept&mdash;one that changes with a person&rsquo;s identities, experiences, age, location, peers/family, etc.?</li>
                <li>If you can&rsquo;t think of anything, just write gibberish of the same word over until something pops into your brain.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, go to Microsoft Copilot or ChatGPT. Modify the following prompt to give the AI a <span style="background-color: #ffffba;">role</span> | <span style="background-color: #bae1ff;">task</span> | <span style="background-color: #baffc9;">format</span>:
            <blockquote><span style="background-color: #ffffba;">You are a first-year college student away from home for the first time</span> and are <span style="background-color: #bae1ff;">tasked with brainstorming on the concept of &ldquo;home.&rdquo; Generate</span> <span style="background-color: #baffc9;">a list of 10 characteristics about the concept &ldquo;home&rdquo; that could be expanded into a 1000-word essay.</span></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>After the AI has created its list, compare the output to your list and reflect on the similarities and differences:
            <ul>
                <li>What ideas interest you between the two lists?</li>
                <li>How can you expand upon things that you and/or AI created?</li>
                <li>Why could using AI to help you &ldquo;think&rdquo; be useful?</li>
                <li>What issues could arise by using AI in the invention stage of the writing process?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="prompt-link">Consult the list of questions on &ldquo;home&rdquo; as needed to extend discussion and reflection:

                <li>A Place or a Feeling: Do you associate &ldquo;home&rdquo; more with a location or a sentiment?</li>
                <li>Home&rsquo;s Boundaries: How do you establish personal boundaries within your &ldquo;home?&rdquo;</li>
