    <h1>Setting Clear Expectations for AI Use</h1>

    <p>Clear, specific policies around the use of AI tools help students understand what is permitted in your course&mdash;and just as importantly, what is not. These policies support ethical decision-making, reinforce academic integrity, and build transparency into your teaching practice.</p>

    <h2>Why Clarity Matters: Promoting Transparency in Learning</h2>

    <p>Transparent expectations support more than just compliance. They create inclusive, student-centered classrooms where learning goals are clearly communicated. Vague or inconsistent messages about AI use can lead to confusion, unintentional misuse, or even Honor Code violations. Students may not always know when or how it&rsquo;s acceptable to use AI tools, especially when norms vary across disciplines or assignments.</p>

    <p>Transparency helps by</p>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li><strong>Clarifying your pedagogical goals</strong> so students know what they are expected to learn independently and where AI can support their learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Reducing academic anxiety</strong> by making success criteria and boundaries visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Encouraging metacognition</strong> by asking students to reflect on how and why they use AI tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Building trust</strong> by positioning the classroom as a space for ethical growth, not punitive enforcement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One effective way to build this kind of transparency is to adapt the <a href="https://tilthighered.com/tiltexamplesandresources">Transparency in Learning and Teaching (TILT) framework</a>. A transparent AI policy or assignment typically includes:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li><strong>The purpose:</strong> Why are students doing this task on their own? What skills or knowledge does it build?</li>
        <li><strong>The task:</strong> What exactly are students being asked to do and avoid with AI tools?</li>
        <li><strong>The criteria for success:</strong> How will appropriate AI use be documented or assessed?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Suggested Elements of a Course AI Policy</h2>

    <p>When writing your syllabus or assignment guidelines, consider including the following elements:</p>

    <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
    <p>State your overall approach to AI use. Is it permitted, restricted, or prohibited? Do policies vary by assignment?</p>

    <h3>Assignment-Specific Boundaries</h3>
    <p>Rather than repeating a long list of dos and don&rsquo;ts, use a simple chart to show what is allowed across different assignment types. This approach supports clarity and consistency:</p>

    <table class="alternateTable">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">Assignment Type / Task</th>
                <th scope="col">AI Use Allowed?</th>
                <th scope="col">Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Brainstorming project ideas</td>
                <td>&#x2705; Yes</td>
                <td>ChatGPT or similar tools may be used to explore and refine topics.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Drafting lab reports</td>
                <td>&#10060; No</td>
                <td>Reports must be written in your own words, based on your own data.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Generating visual content for a slideshow</td>
                <td>&#x2705; Yes</td>
                <td>Use of AI image tools permitted with citation of source and prompts.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Writing literature reviews</td>
                <td>&#10060; No</td>
                <td>You must read, analyze, and synthesize sources independently.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Programming support or debugging</td>
                <td>&#x2705; Yes</td>
                <td>GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT allowed for debugging, not full solutions.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Solving problem sets</td>
                <td>&#10060; No</td>
                <td>Unless otherwise stated, AI use on graded problem sets is prohibited.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Language translation for drafts</td>
                <td>&#x2705; Yes</td>
                <td>Translation tools allowed; final version should reflect your own voice.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Peer review feedback</td>
                <td>&#x2705; Yes</td>
                <td>AI may be used to polish peer feedback but not to write it entirely.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Documentation and Attribution</h3>
    <p>If AI use is permitted, specify how students should disclose it. Common options include:</p>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>A brief statement at the end of the assignment (e.g., &ldquo;Used Grammarly for grammar check.&rdquo;)</li>
        <li>A process reflection describing how AI tools supported their work</li>
        <li>Formal citation of AI-generated content (e.g., in APA or MLA format)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Consequences for Misuse</h3>
    <p>Align your policy with the Virginia Tech Honor Code. Clearly state that unauthorized or deceptive AI use may be considered academic misconduct. For example:</p>
    <p>Any use of AI tools that violates the course policy or misrepresents your authorship will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct under the Virginia Tech Honor Code.</p>

    <h2>Sample Policy Language</h2>

    <p>You are encouraged to tailor policy language to reflect your course goals and discipline-specific norms. Here are a few adaptable examples:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>You may use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, DALL&middot;E) for brainstorming and support, but all final writing and design work must be your own. Include a note disclosing any tools used and how they supported your process.</li>
        <li>AI tools are not permitted on quizzes, exams, or major assignments unless explicitly stated. Submitting AI-generated content as your own is a violation of the Virginia Tech Honor Code.</li>
        <li>Use of AI for checking grammar, syntax, or code structure is permitted. You may not use AI to generate substantive content unless an assignment explicitly allows it. All AI use must be documented in a short statement of process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reinforcing Expectations</h2>

    <p>Even the clearest syllabus policy may be forgotten if it isn&rsquo;t reinforced. Revisit your AI expectations when introducing assignments, modeling appropriate tool use, or giving feedback. Encouraging reflection and open discussion helps students internalize policies, make ethical decisions, and develop confidence in their own skills.</p>
