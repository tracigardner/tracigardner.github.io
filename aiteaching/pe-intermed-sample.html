                <td>You are an experienced technical writing teacher. You need to create a new version of a technical writing course that does two things: (1) teaches students to use AI ethically to improve their writing and (2) teaches students how to learn technical writing skills, including specific genres, and concepts, including rhetoric, plain language, document design, and ethics. Please develop a 15-week topical outline for this course.</td>

                <td>This prompt effectively guides beginners in AI and prompting by being clear and structured. It specifies two main goals: ethical AI use and technical writing skills. The inclusion of examples like genres, rhetoric, plain language, document design, and ethics clarifies the expectations. Additionally, asking for a 15-week topical outline sets a concrete deliverable, helping users understand the scope and detail needed. By clearly defining tasks and providing context, the prompt ensures users know exactly what to focus on, making it easier to construct an intermediate-level prompt.</td>

                <td>This prompt is useful for teaching AI prompt creation by demonstrating clear structure and organization. It shows how to break down complex information into manageable sections and emphasizes the importance of including relevant details, such as identifying the context (graduate-level course).</td>

                <td>You are a teacher of Victorian Literature. Next week, you will be starting Charlotte Bronte&rsquo;s Jane Eyre. You have briefly introduced students to the controversies surrounding the publication of the novel, and now you would like to create a new lecture based on those controversies. The class period during which you would deliver this lecture is 50 minutes in length, but you would like to use the last 20 minutes of class for an in-class writing. Please create a possible outline for this lecture that would last for 30 minutes.</td>

                <td>This prompt helps beginners in AI and prompting by being clear, detailed, and structured. It specifies the teacher&rsquo;s role and the subject (Victorian Literature and Jane Eyre). By mentioning the controversies and the exact timing for the lecture and writing activity, it provides clear constraints and expectations. This helps users understand the importance of context, specificity, and time management in crafting an intermediate-level prompt. Additionally, asking for a 30-minute outline encourages users to break down tasks logically, demonstrating how to structure responses effectively.</td>
