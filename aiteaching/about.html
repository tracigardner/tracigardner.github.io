        <h3>Cohort Background</h3>
        <p>I am reaching out to faculty at Virginia Tech who have been exploring the pedagogical implications of generative artificial intelligence to let you know about an opportunity to join a funded faculty cohort: &ldquo;Teaching in the Age of Generative AI.&rdquo; You are receiving this email because you are a member of the TLOS Generative AI Community of Practice or have attended TLOS workshops about using AI for teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>In partnership with the Provost&rsquo;s Office, TLOS is accepting applications for an AI-centered course enhancement grant. This grant, supported by funds from the 4-VA initiative, will provide awardees with a $5,000 summer stipend to design or redesign assignments, assessments, and/or classroom activities to leverage generative AI&mdash;and to ensure that AI is used responsibly and appropriately. Grant recipients will join a cohort of faculty (15&ndash;20 people) from a range of disciplines to deepen their understanding of generative AI, collaborate with colleagues to review and refine their course materials, and collectively develop a set of recommendations for other faculty at Virginia Tech to consider when integrating generative AI into their courses.</p>
        <p>Faculty selected to join this cohort will begin meeting during the final weeks of spring semester, but the bulk of our work will take place during the summer months. In order to be eligible for this grant, you must be available to participate in an intensive two-day workshop in Blacksburg on May 22&ndash;23, you must be able to join regular cohort meetings via Zoom between May and August (schedule TBD by the cohort), and you must be eligible to receive a salary stipend during the Summer I term. Due to funding constraints, graduate student teaching assistants are not eligible to participate; this is a faculty-only cohort.</p>
