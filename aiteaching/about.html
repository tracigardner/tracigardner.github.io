    <h2>About This Site</h2>

    <p>The Teaching in the Age of Generative AI faculty cohort formed in May 2024. In partnership with the Provost&rsquo;s Office, TLOS organized members with funding from an AI-centered course enhancement grant. This grant, supported by funds from the 4-VA initiative, will provide awardees with a summer stipend to design or redesign assignments, assessments, and/or classroom activities to leverage generative AI&mdash;and to ensure that AI is used responsibly and appropriately. </p>

    <p>Grant recipients joined a cohort of faculty (listed in the Cohort Working Groups below) from a range of disciplines to deepen their understanding of generative AI, collaborate with colleagues to review and refine their course materials, and collectively develop a set of recommendations for other faculty at Virginia Tech to consider when integrating generative AI into their courses.</p>
