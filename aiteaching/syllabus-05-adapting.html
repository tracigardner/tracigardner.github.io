    <h1>Adapting Your Policy Over Time</h1>

    <div style="border: 6px double #506590;padding: 12px;background-color: #f2f2f2;border-radius: 6px;margin-bottom: 24px;">

    <p>Setting clear policies for AI use is important, but so is staying open to change. As generative AI tools continue to evolve, so will the ways students use them, the challenges they pose, and the opportunities they offer. Your AI policy doesn&rsquo;t have to be set in stone. In fact, treating it as a living document can make your course more responsive, inclusive, and aligned with your learning goals.</p>

    <p>Framing your policy as flexible doesn&rsquo;t mean lowering your standards. It means being transparent with students about your reasoning, staying curious about how tools are being used, and making room for course-level adjustments when new needs arise.</p>

    <h2>Why Iteration Matters</h2>

    <p>What feels appropriate in week one may not feel the same in week ten. You might discover that students are using tools in ways you hadn&rsquo;t anticipated, or that certain policies create barriers for students with different levels of experience or access. A flexible approach allows you to:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Reflect on how AI use is supporting or interfering with your learning outcomes</li>
        <li>Respond to new technologies or capabilities as they emerge mid-semester</li>
        <li>Address confusion or unintentional misuse before it becomes a conduct issue</li>
        <li>Build trust by showing students that you&rsquo;re learning and adapting too</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Just as students are developing their own understanding of AI tools, you can model responsible decision-making by refining your policy as you learn more.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Mid-Semester Adjustments</h2>

    <p>If you choose to revisit or revise your AI policy during the semester, here are some strategies that can help:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li><strong>Check in with students</strong><br>
            Use a short survey, discussion board, or in-class activity to ask students how they&rsquo;re using AI, what&rsquo;s working, and where they&rsquo;re confused. This can surface patterns you might not see in individual assignments.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Clarify expectations for upcoming assignments</strong><br>
            If your policy is shifting, restate what&rsquo;s allowed or prohibited on a specific task. Even a brief slide or reminder can go a long way.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Acknowledge your reasoning</strong><br>
            When you make a change, explain why. For example, you might say, &ldquo;After seeing how the first drafts were developed, I realized we need to be more specific about when full-text generation is okay and when it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo; This kind of transparency builds credibility and helps students understand your pedagogical priorities.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Make updates visible</strong><br>
            If you revise your syllabus policy, share a copy of the change as a new paragraph in the syllabus, a Canvas announcement, or a slide in class. Invite students to ask questions or raise concerns.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Stay grounded in your values</strong><br>
            The same values that guided your original policy&mdash;like promoting integrity, equity, and trust&mdash;can also guide your updates. Revisit the Principles of Community to help frame adjustments in a consistent, student-centered way.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Encouraging Feedback and Reflection</h2>

    <p>Your students are active participants in the classroom culture around AI. You can empower them to help shape that culture by inviting reflection and feedback. Consider:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Adding a reflective question to an assignment:<br>
            <em>How did you use AI while working on this task? What did you learn about its strengths or limitations?</em>
        </li>
        <li>Asking for end-of-unit feedback:<br>
            <em>Do the AI guidelines in this course make sense to you? Are there areas that feel unclear or unrealistic?</em>
        </li>
        <li>Creating space for suggestions:<br>
            <em>If you could revise the AI policy for this course, what would you change and why?</em>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>These kinds of questions can help you identify what&rsquo;s working and what needs rethinking. They also send a message that students&rsquo; perspectives matter and that your policy is not just about enforcement, but about learning.</p>

    <h2>A Living Document</h2>

    <p>Your AI policy is not a one-time decision; it&rsquo;s a conversation. By treating it as a living document, you show students that it&rsquo;s okay to learn, adapt, and revise your thinking. That mindset not only reflects the reality of teaching with fast-changing tools, it also models the intellectual flexibility we hope to cultivate in our students.</p>
