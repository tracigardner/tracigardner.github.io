    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Rhetorical Knowledge, Writing Processes, and Genre Conventions</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>To create a concise and comprehensive summary of ONE of the Two Articles and AI Rhetorical Analysis using generative AI and prepare for a future rhetorical analysis assignment.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Remember, the goal of this assignment is not just to create a summary, but also to explore how generative AI can assist in the writing process. Happy summarizing! &#128522;</p>
    <ol class="skipline">
        <li><strong>Read the Document:</strong> Begin by reading the attached document &ldquo;ArtAI.pdf&rdquo;. This document discusses the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the art community, the ethical considerations, and technical advancements in generative models, with a particular focus on AI&rsquo;s intersection with art and creativity.<br><br>
            <strong>OR</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Read the Document:</strong> Begin by reading the attached document &ldquo;AIClimateChange.pdf&rdquo;. This document discusses the indirect impacts of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and social media on the climate crisis.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use Generative AI:</strong> Use Copilot, set on &ldquo;Balanced&rdquo; or &ldquo;Precise,&rdquo; to help create a summary of the document. This could be a tool you&rsquo;re familiar with or a new one you&rsquo;d like to explore. Remember, the goal is to use the AI as a tool to assist you, not to do the work for you. Here is an example prompt (modify it as you see fit):
            <blockquote>You are a first-year writing student in college. You are tasked with creating a summary and getting a general understanding of the attached PDF. Provide insight into the main claim, key subclaims, important examples, and other features necessary to write a summary that can be used in a rhetorical analysis essay.</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Create a Summary:</strong> Write a summary of the document. Your summary should be concise, yet comprehensive enough to include all the main points and arguments presented in the document. It should be written in your own words, even if you used an AI tool to help generate it.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare for Rhetorical Analysis:</strong> As you write your summary, consider how you might use it in a future rhetorical analysis assignment. Think about the document&rsquo;s use of logical arguments (logos), emotional appeals (pathos), ethical credibility (ethos), and timeliness (kairos).</li>
        <li><strong>Reflect on the Process:</strong> After you&rsquo;ve completed your summary, write a brief reflection on the process. How did the generative AI tool assist you? What were its limitations? How might you use AI tools in future writing assignments?</li>

        <li><strong>Weekly Submission:</strong> Turn in your summary and reflection as a single document.</li>
    </ol>
