    <p class="byline">Assignment created by Shakil Rabbi (Department of English)</p>

    <h2>Assignment Description</h2>
    <p>
        In Project 2, students will analyze and revise a case study focused on intercultural issues using AI tools. The project involves identifying and examining 2&ndash;5 key intercultural problems, such as sexism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, gender bias, religious bias, size bias, ability bias, diet bias, language bias, or other intercultural challenges in a case composed through AI. Students must analyze the assumptions underlying the case, how they impact the organization and its employees, and who is responsible for addressing these issues. The primary task is to develop a case study, analyze the existing problems, and then revise it based on insights from research and personal experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should develop this case study with a sense of rhetorical performance for the genre. You should also reflect on the process to help you identify issues that you want to pursue further and offer practical solutions. Through this assignment, students will gain a deeper appreciation of the complexities of intercultural dynamics within modern, technologically advanced work environments.
    </p>

    <p><strong>The assignment includes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Original 750-word case study developed by AI</li>
        <li>2&ndash;3 page analysis of the original case study</li>
        <li>1&ndash;2 page recommendation for fictional personnel on the case based on research</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
        You can start to think about these issues by analyzing a case developed through AI. Once you have a case study (of 750 words) that speaks to issues of cultural differences and biases, try to analyze them through application of keywords. You should summarize the issue you identify in 2&ndash;3 sentences and use 2&ndash;3 headers that organize your ideas into groups. Finally, include implications that determine the social implication based on identities, biases, and assumptions.
    </p>

    <h2>Revision</h2>
    <p>
        Now you should develop the original case study to elaborate on the details in terms of your own knowledge of the issue. You should flesh out the sections that AI produces to elaborate on the following things:
    </p>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Who is the person the event impacted? What do they do for the company?</li>
        <li>How long have they been an employee? What are their responsibilities?</li>
        <li>What is their power and privilege within the workplace? What industry are they in?</li>
        <li>How might this incident influence their performance?</li>
        <li>How did the event get reported or witnessed? Was it rumor-based?</li>
        <li>What actions were taken? Has such a citation occurred before or is this a new development?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Set the Scene</h2>
    <p>
        Provide background information, relevant facts, and the most important issue related to the event. What specifically happened? What do we need to know to understand the event that has occurred? Why is the intercultural issue a concern within the workplace?
    </p>

    <h2>Demonstrate That You Are Knowledgeable</h2>
    <p>
        Consider researching the problems in this case study revision. You should consider reading on the topics you include in your case study to ensure your revision is a strong one. You can also use your personal experiences and/or opinions (imagination?) to add realistic context.
    </p>

    <h2>Provide Details</h2>
    <p>
        Include dialogue, images, and other specifics that might help build the case studyâ€™s realism.
    </p>

    <h2>Include the Following Sections in Your Revised Case Study:</h2>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Briefly outline and provide context for the case study.</li>
        <li><strong>Incident:</strong> Describe with as much detail as possible the nature of the intercultural incident.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact of the Incident:</strong> Provide information on what the result of the incident is for the employee.</li>
        <li><strong>Steps Taken to Address the Incident:</strong> Describe how supervisors and other employees responded to the incident.</li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Summarize the case study and offer information for the readers.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Provide at least three recommendations to prevent and/or address the intercultural issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Additional Information:</strong> Suggest broader actions employers and employees can take, including trainings and resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Formatting Requirements</h2>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Include headers, subheads, bolding, italicizing, color, bulleted and enumerated lists as needed.</li>
        <li>Single-space the documents; margins are based on styling choices.</li>
        <li>Include a title and your name for the analysis and revision.</li>
        <li>Include page numbers (bottom right) and optionally your last name.</li>
        <li>Use a serif or sans serif font in a logical size.</li>
        <li>Provide appropriate captions for images (no larger than half a page).</li>
        <li>Ensure documents match in appearance where possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Writing</h2>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li><strong>Voice Matters:</strong> Choose between first and third person to influence tone and objectivity. Combine carefully if using both.</li>
        <li><strong>Titles Matter:</strong> Craft specific, engaging titles with action verbs and data.</li>
        <li><strong>Language Matters:</strong> Use clear, simple language. Avoid jargon or corporate-speak.</li>
        <li><strong>Research + Numbers Matter:</strong> Include data and statistics for credibility and support.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-up Matters:</strong> Include your name, email, and a brief bio for credibility and contact.</li>
        <li><strong>Design Matters:</strong> Use visual elements to improve readability and engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Format Matters:</strong> Structure content logically and keep it concise.</li>
