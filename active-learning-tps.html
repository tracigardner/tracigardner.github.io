        Gardner, Traci. 2024. &ldquo;Think-Pair-Share (Active Learning Strategy).&rdquo; Teaching Writing Across the Curriculum with AI (blog). September 15, 2024. <a href="https://teachingwacwithai.tracigardner.com/level/undergraduate/think-pair-share…earning-strategy/">https://teachingwacwithai.tracigardner.com/level/undergraduate/think-pair-share-active-learning-strategy/</a></p>

    <p>The Think-Pair-Share Active Learning Strategy uses critical thinking alongside collaborative synthesis to activate prior knowledge, increase participation and discussion, and reflect on recently-covered concepts. The strategy works best with open-ended questions, rather than yes-no style questions. Here are some general examples of topics students can focus on:
    <ul>
        <li>Ask a question about probability or estimation that has multiple possible responses.</li>
        <li>Focus the activity on prediction (e.g., what will happen next?).</li>
        <li>Answer a question about a recent discussion: What was the most important take-away?</li>
        <li>Ask students to shape class discussion: What would you like to discuss further?</li>
        <li>Consider an ethical situation that will have multiple responses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p>One of the biggest challenges for fully online courses, especially asynchronous courses, is the Pair stage. It&rsquo;s frequently impossible to pair students when everyone is in a different place and may be working at very different times. As a result, students have a difficult time finding an available partner for the Pair stage of this activity.</p>

    <p>The solution? Ask AI to serve as the second voice (or partner) in the Pairs. Students still write down their thoughts in the Think stage and still interact with another voice as they work to negotiate their responses. Finally, they can still report out by posting their chat transcript as an assignment or in an online discussion.</p>
    <p>In hybrid or in-person classes, students can complete the Think-Pair-Share activity is a chatbot as a reflection on the previous session or as preparation for the next session. They can then report on their activity in a class meeting in the Share stage.</p>

    <h3>Example Think-Pair-Share Prompt for AI</h3>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://teachingwacwithai.tracigardner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/chatgpt-think-pair-share-prompt.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Think-Pair-Share prompt </a> that I wrote for students in my technical communications course:</p>

    <blockquote style="background-color: #f8f8f8;padding: 12px 24px;">
        <code>
            <p>I am a college student in an upper-level technical communication class at a four-year university. You are taking the role of another student in the course. You will guide our interaction. I want to chat with you using the Think-Pair-Share Active Learning Strategy. For this activity, we are focusing on this ethical scenario: “How should a software company respond to the misuse of its AI technology in creating deep fake videos?” We&rsquo;ll follow these instructions:<br>
                1. Ask me to think about the topic and write my thoughts and submit them to you. Give me time to work, and do not say anything more until I post my ideas. <br>
                2. Explain your thoughts on the topic, and then stop. Use only your ideas. Do not refer to what I have written.<br>
                3. Ask me to respond to your ideas and consider how they compare to your ideas. Encourage me to work toward combining the ideas. Do not combine the ideas for me. Give me time to work, and do not say anything more until I post my response.<br>
                4. Respond to the combined ideas, indicating whether they effectively represent our ideas. If you think revision is necessary, ask me questions about strategies to improve the comments. Do not make the changes for me. Give me time to answer your questions. <br>
                5. Continue collaborating with me until I am satisfied with our combined ideas on the topic.</p>
</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Students copy and paste the prompt directly into the AI tool of their choice. It&rsquo;s formatted for the chat as a basic text document, so it doesn&rsquo;t have the document design I usually use in course documents.</p>

    <p>The prompt uses specific features to guide the active learning strategy and result in a collaboration that simulates the interaction in a in-person classroom. First, the prompt opens with details on the <strong>audience</strong>:</p>
    <blockquote>

        <code>I am a college student in an upper-level technical communication class at a four-year university.</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This statement sets the audience level for the interaction: junior and senior college students taking a technical communication course. The bot isn&rsquo;t addressing eighth graders or retirees. It&rsquo;s addressing a particular subset of college students.</p>

    <p>Next, the prompt sets the <strong>role</strong> that the chatbot will play in this interaction:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>You are taking the role of another student in the course. You will guide our interaction.</code>
    </blockquote>
    This part of the prompt tells the chatbot two things. First, it lets the chatbot know that it is just like the audience: a college student in a technical communication class. Second, it tells the chatbot that it will control the conversation. In this active learning activity, controlling the conversation means that it will ask questions and wait for responses. More details on this role will come later in the prompt.

    <p>The chatbot also needs to know what the specific <strong>task</strong> is that it needs to accomplish.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>I want to chat with you using the Think-Pair-Share Active Learning Strategy.</code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Using the exact name here can help since the AI tool may know exactly what the Think-Pair-Share Active Learning Strategy is. If it doesn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s okay because the prompt will explain more.</p>

    <p>Additionally, I tell the tool what our specific focus for this activity is:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>For this activity, we are focusing on this ethical scenario: “<a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/assignments/try-its/ai/ai-deep-fakes.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How should a software company respond to the misuse of its AI technology in creating deep fake videos?</a>”</code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>more here</p>

    <p>Finally, I give the AI tool <strong>step-by-step instructions</strong> on how I want it to interact with the student and then listing the numbered steps we&rsquo;ll follow:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <code>
            We&rsquo;ll follow these instructions:
            1. Ask me to think about the topic and write my thoughts and submit them to you. Give me time to work, and do not say anything more until I post my ideas. <br>
            2. Explain your thoughts on the topic, and then stop. Use only your ideas. Do not refer to what I have written.<br>
            3. Ask me to respond to your ideas and consider how they compare to your ideas. Encourage me to work toward combining the ideas. Do not combine the ideas for me. Give me time to work, and do not say anything more until I post my response.<br>
            4. Respond to the combined ideas, indicating whether they effectively represent our ideas. If you think revision is necessary, ask me questions about strategies to improve the comments. Do not make the changes for me. Give me time to answer your questions. <br>
            5. Continue collaborating with me until I am satisfied with our combined ideas on the topic.
        </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Notice that I give it not only information about what it will talk about in the interaction, but also how and when I want to talk about the topic:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>1. Ask me to think about the topic and write my thoughts and submit them to you. Give me time to work, and do not say anything more until I post my ideas.</code>
    </blockquote>

    Without this kind of instructions, the AI may jump ahead before the student has a chance to think things out.

    <p>Another example of this kind of instructions is in the second step in the instructions:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <code>2. Explain your thoughts on the topic, and then stop. Use only your ideas. Do not refer to what I have written.</code>
    </blockquote>

    In this step, I want to make it clear that the tool does not move on to discussion and synergy. I want the student to take control of that work. After all, I&rsquo;m teaching the student to think and analyze the scenario (not the chatbot).

    <p>I also give the AI tool instructions on how to interact with the student:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <code>Encourage me to work toward combining the ideas. Do not combine the ideas for me. Give me time to work, and do not say anything more until I post my response.</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Students can see this entire prompt, as they will copy and paste it into their AI tool. It&rsquo;s completely transparent. No tricks.

    <p>So let&rsquo;s look at the response.</p>
