		<h2>Challenge</h2>

		<p>Folks in the course have reported group members who they cannot contact or who are not responding and other group members who are not contributing to the projects.</p>

		<h2>Existing Resources</h2>
		<p>I have shared these resources for groups already:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/discussion_topics/1700429">How You&rsquo;ll Collaborate This Term</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/discussion_topics/1720228" target="_blank">FAQ: Group Work</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>New Solutions</h2>

		<p>We need some strategies that will address the challenges and help groups work more smoothly. Reflecting on the questions that have come up so far, I&rsquo;m suggesting some things I would like all groups to do and then adding some things that groups can do if they want.</p>

		<h3>Things I Would Like Groups to Do</h3>

		<ul class="skipline" id="things-to-do">
			<li><b>Track meetings and plans in the new <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/discussion_topics/1732075" target="_blank">Group Updates Discussion</a>.<br>
				</b>You can help solve some of the issues by adding details to the new <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/discussion_topics/1732075" target="_blank">Group Updates Discussion</a>. Keep a running update on what the group and group members are doing (group meetings, when a group member is out of town for the weekend, etc.). I&rsquo;ll check this Discussion to find details on your group when I need them.</li>

			<li><b>Focus on Project Management.<br>
				</b>The focus of the group projects is not just to learn how to write
				proposals, progress reports, and formal reports. They&rsquo;re also to learn about project management. Keep in mind that the <i>process</i> of writing the projects is just as important as the <i>product</i> you end up with.</li>

			<li><b>Track your individual work for the Project Wrappers.<br>
				</b>The Project Wrappers for these last three Major Projects will ask you to
				record how you contributed to each project. Keep track while you&rsquo;re working so it will be easy for you to add them to the wrapper later.</li>

			<li><b>Post contact info for group members.<br>
				</b>Make sure everyone in the group has contact information for all members. Contact info can be whatever you want (email, phone numbers, etc.). I cannot give out email addresses because of FERPA guidelines. Here are two options:
				<ul>
					<li>If you listed contact information in <a target="_blank" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/assignments/1919117">Try-It #13: Group Contract, Schedule, &amp; Meeting Minutes</a>. upload a copy of Try-It #13 so everyone can find the information.</li>

					<li>If it&rsquo;s not in Try-It #13 (or as a backup), list the details in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/discussion_topics/1732075" target="_blank">Group Updates Discussion</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Focus on these actions if someone does not do their part.</b> <br>
				Whether someone disappears, can&rsquo;t be contacted, or is having trouble with the work, your group can search for a way to collaborate and get the work done. Here are the steps I would like you to try if this situation comes up:
				<ol>
					<li><i>Try to find out why.</i> Things happen. Maybe the person is sick (physically or
						mentally). Maybe the person is swamped with work. Maybe the person needs help finding the resources to get the work done. Whatever the reason, your group should start by trying to find out. Being humane and supportive is more valuable than a perfect memo.</li>

					<li><i>Get them help if needed.</i> In some cases, you can help them yourselves. In other cases, you might want to suggest other resources. The Writing Center is a great resource if someone is having trouble getting started or needs help with any part of the writing process. You can also let me know what I can do to help.</li>

					<li><i>Solve the issue among the group members. </i>Once you know what&rsquo;s going on and address the issue, your group should be able to find a way forward. Maybe you need to adjust the work schedule. Perhaps you need to have a working meeting where members write together. As much as possible, try to solve the problem as a group. </li>

					<li><i>Talk to me if you need more help.</i> Finding your own way is a large part of what project management is about. That said, I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> saying that you can&rsquo;t ask for help. Let me know what you&rsquo;ve tried and what you&rsquo;d like me to do.</li>

					<li><i>Note what&rsquo;s going on if it&rsquo;s time to submit your work.</i> Everyone should have until the Target Due Date for each of the assignments. If the Target Due Date is here however and you&rsquo;re not sure when the missing person will deliver their work, add a note in your project that explains what&rsquo;s going on. You can write something like this:<br>
						<code>
					This section is missing from our report. Tian Tian has COVID and is not able to do their part of the report for at least another week.</code>
						<br>
						Additionally add a Submission Comment to tell me what&rsquo;s going on. Be sure to include details on when (or if) the missing work can be added.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Things groups can do if they want</h3>
		<ul class="skipline" id="can-do">
			<li><b>Document any issues that come up with team members.<br>
				</b>If the group is experiencing any conflicts or issues, be sure to document what&rsquo;s going on and how you have worked to resolve the challenges. In the workplace, documentation can be critical. </li>

			<li><b>Create a team calendar for the rest of the term.<br>
				</b>To keep everyone on track, a calendar can really help. You can set up a
				group calendar with <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/troubleshoot/calendaring/how-to-share-calendar-and-contacts">Office365</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37095?hl=en">Google Calendar</a>. You can also use the <a target="_blank" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-a-group-calendar/ta-p/269">Group Calendar in Canvas</a>. Or go low-tech and make a word processor file with a list of dates and what&rsquo;s due on which days. Begin my adding the Target Due Dates and then add the dates for meetings and submitting drafts that your group has come up with.</li>

			<li><b>Choose a better name for your group.<br>
				</b>If you&rsquo;re tired of being Afternoon 3 or Early Evening 1, your group can choose a name (classroom-friendly, of course). Let me know, and I will change your name in Canvas.</li>

			<li><b>Know what you can do as a group in Canvas.<br>
				</b>Your group is all yours. You can add Discussions, Pages, and Files. You can
				add dates to your group&rsquo;s Calendar. Here are links to the documentation:

				for your Canvas Notifications. Check this documentation:
