    <p>Nothing can feel worse than asking for help and hearing nothing. If someone asks your group for help, jump in and offer whatever you can.</p>
    <p>Even if you can&rsquo;t help immediately, you can let them know that you hear them and will help when you can. Be specific about what you can do and when you can do it.</p>
