				<p class="site-credit" style="margin-bottom: 4px;">I acknowledge the Tutelo/Monacan people, who are the traditional custodians of the land on which this site was created and is maintained, and recognize their continuing connection to the land, water, and air that I consume. I pay respect to the Tutelo/Monacan Nations, and to their elders past, present, and emerging. To learn more, visit <a href="https://www.monacannation.com/" target="_blank">the Monacan Nation website</a>. Additionally, you can visit the <a href="https://ccc.vt.edu/index/aiicc.html">American Indian &amp; Indigenous Community Center</a> in 122 Squires Student Center.</p>
				<p class="site-credit" style="margin-bottom: 4px;">I also acknowledge the enslaved Black people who lived and worked on the former plantation lands upon which Virginia Tech stands. These families include the Fractions, McNortons, and Saunders, as well as others. Read more about these families in the <em>Virginia Tech Magazine</em> article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.vtmag.vt.edu/fall15/family-tree.html">Family Tree</a>.&rdquo;</p>
