<h3>Ask for Feedback</h3>
<div style="width: 300px;padding: 6px;border: 3px double #861F41;float: right;margin-left: 12px;">
<img src="../-images/noun_Tips_2021795.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Tip Icon" style="float:left;"> Great job indicating your group when you posted your request for feedback last week. Remember to do the same this week by paying attention to Step 4b–c.
</div>
<ol>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Reread your responses to the Revision Plan for Your Poster in Canvas, looking for an issue you would like to ask for additional help with. The idea for this activity is to choose something you are thinking of changing, but want advice on before revising.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Review the <a title="Feedback Discussions Overview" href="../writing-strategies/feedback-discusssions-overview.html" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/116340/pages/feedback-discussions-overview" data-api-returntype="Page">Feedback Discussions Overview</a> if you need a reminder of the differences between formative and summative feedback.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Go to our course site  by clicking Piazza in the Canvas sidebar.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Create a new post for your passage:
  <ol type="a">
  <li>Mark the Post Type of &ldquo;Question.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Post your passage and question to your “Class Group.”</li>
  <li>Choose your group from the dropdown menu under  “Class Group.” You are in only one group, so it will be the only one that appears.</li>
  <li>Choose the folder name that corresponds to the project you are working on—ethics_poster.</li>
  <li>Write a clear Summary, which works as the subject line. See <a href="../genres/strong-subject-lines.html">Strong Subject Lines</a> if you need help.</li>
  <li>Add the  current draft of your poster—OR if you are focusing on something specific (like a passage or a portion of the image you want to revise) add a specific block of text or region of the image.</li>
  <li>Add a request for specific feedback about your potential revision in the Details area.Choose a specific question that cannot be answered with “yes” or “no.”</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Post your discussion once you have finished. Be sure to post by 11:59 PM Thursday each week so that others have time to respond.</li>
<li>If desired, you can post more than one request for feedback. You can also ask follow-up questions if you need more information.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Give Feedback to Your Classmates</h3>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Read and respond to the revision plans and questions posted by others in the class. </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Begin by responding to someone who has no feedback, if possible. We want everyone to get feedback.</li>
<li>Respond to as many requests for feedback as you can. The more effort you put in, the more you will learn about writing and responding to documents.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Grading Process</span></h2>
<p>You track and grade your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">Track your work in your Weekly Work Log.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">Claim points for your Feedback Discussion when you complete the Self-Assessment for the week in Canvas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Post your requests for feedback early enough to allow others in the course to respond before the end of the grace period. If you do not post your request for feedback <span style="margin-bottom: 12px;">by 11:59 PM Thursday each week</span>, you cannot claim points for posting a passage that week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, if you do not provide feedback for others by the end of the grace period, you cannot claim any points for those activities during the related week in your self-assessment.</p>
<h2>Feedback Discussions FAQ</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Do I have to read every Feedback Discussion?</dt>
<dd style="margin-bottom: 12px;">No, but it may help you. By reading the passages and questions from others in the class, you may figure out how to improve your own project. Practically, it is up to you. The goal of this course is to put in your best effort, so do your best.</dd>

<dt>Do I have to respond to every single Feedback Discussion to receive credit?</dt>
<dd style="margin-bottom: 12px;">No, you do not have to respond to every post. Remember that the feedback process is a collaborative task though. When you help out your classmates, they have more motivation to help you in return. Again, the goal of this course is to put in your best effort, so do your best.</dd>

<dt>Do I have to respond on the same day of posting?</dt>
<dd style="margin-bottom: 12px;">No, you do not have to respond on the same day as the posting. Just respond by the end of the grace period (Mondays at 11:59PM) so you can indicate your work in the self-assessment.</dd>

<dt>Can I ask for feedback on more than one passage a week?</dt>
<dd style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Certainly. Ideally, the class will develop a collegial give-and-take feeling in the Feedback Discussions. If you need more help, ask for it. If you can help someone else, do so!</dd>
