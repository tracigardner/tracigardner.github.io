You may have worked in an internship or job in your field. You may have experience working in a job here on campus. You may have worked in an after-school or summer job while you were in high school. You may have experience watching a family member or friend in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what experience you have, you have seen documents in the workplace&mdash;everything from posters on the bulletin boards to contracts, and from letters to proposals. You may have even written some documents yourself, like an email to your supervisor asking for a day off or a memo that provided your team with an update on your work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your experience has surely taught you some tricks and strategies to survive as a writer in the workplace. You might think about these questions as you consider what you already know about writing on the job:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do you start?</li>
<li>How do you do it?&nbsp;What techniques do you use?</li>
<li>How do you keep everything organized?</li>
<li>How do you remember how to incorporate details and evidence?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What can you do to make sure people read what you write?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a way to introduce yourself to the class, write a reply that tells us about one of the tricks you have learned or developed. In your post, tell us the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>your major and career goal (i.e., what do you want to be when you graduate).</li>
<li>your secret for writing in the workplace.</li>
<li>how you learned your secret and/or how you figured out that it was effective.</li>
</ul>
