      <dt id="duedates">How do due dates work?</dt>
      <dd>There are three kinds of dates to keep in mind:
        <ul>
          <li>Suggested Due Dates: The date you should aim for. It’s suggested to keep you on track in the course.</li>
          <li>Grace Period: The open period after the suggested due date, during which you can still turn in your work.</li>
          <li>End of Grace Period/Deadline: The last moment you can turn in work for an assignment.</li>
        </ul>
        Read more about the system for due dates on page 6 of the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2022-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall22.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Short Guide to the Course</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt id="deadlines">Should I think of suggested due dates as deadlines?</dt>
      <dd>That is one way to work. If you always aim to have your work in by the suggested due dates, you are more likely to have time to revise and get all your work in. If you can’t though, don’t panic. Adapt the schedule so that it works for you. As long as you turn in your work by the end of the grace period, you should be okay.</dd>
      <dt id="often">How often is work due?</dt>
      <dd>Work is due every week. The easiest way to keep track of the due dates is to consult the Course Summary on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/166227" target="_blank">course homepage</a> (scroll down past the list of modules). The course summary lists every task and its suggested due date.</dd>
      <dt id="closes">Does the grace period start when the assignment closes?</dt>
      <dd>No. The grace period ENDS when the assignment closes in Canvas. Be sure to submit your work before the “available until” passes. No work can be submitted after the assignment closes. Read more about the system for due dates on page 6 of the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2022-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall22.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Short Guide to the Course</a>.</dd>
      <dt id="long">How long do you have after the suggested due date?</dt>
      <dd>It depends. Some work has a three-day grace period. Some work has an open grace period that ends on the last day of the last full week of class (Friday, December 2, 2022 at 11:59 PM). Check the table on page 6 of the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2022-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall22.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Short Guide to the Course</a> for details on how the grace period applies.</dd>
      <dt id="timelimit">Is there a time limit on any assignment (for instance, 2 hours)?</dt>
      <dd>No. There are no timed writings in this course. </dd>
      <dt id="big">Is there a grace period on bigger projects?</dt>
      <dd>Every project during the term has a grace period. The only assignment without a grace period is the final.</dd>
      <dt id="dectwo">So nothing is due until December 2?</dt>
      <dd>No. That’s not the way to think about the assignments in this course—and it’s a sure way to do poorly in the class. Remember also that some work has a shorter, three-day grace period. For open assignments (like the full drafts), December 2 is the LAST day to turn in your work. There are no revisions after December 2. </dd>
      <dt id="countsame">Will work submitted during the grace period be graded the same way as “on time” work?</dt>
      <dd>Yes, it is graded as if it was turned in by the suggested due date.. There is no penalty for using the grace period. </dd>
      <dt id="remember">Do we have to remember which work as a three-day grace period?</dt>
      <dd>You should definitely be aware of how the grace period works, but you can always check the “available until” date in Canvas. The “available until” date is the end of the grace period. Check the table on page 6 of the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2022-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall22.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Short Guide to the Course</a> for a list of which assignments have a three-day grace period and which have an open grace period.</dd>
      <dt id="tue">Having Try-Its on Tuesday is an issue. What can I do?</dt>
      <dd>Choose another day during the week to do the work. The Tuesday and Thursday indication for the Try-Its is meant to help you spread out your work during the week. You can do the task on whatever day of the week you like. Just be sure to submit it before the grace period for the work ends.</dd>
      <dt id="notify">Do we need to notify you if we turn in work during the grace period?</dt>
      <dd>Nope. I’ll get a notification in Canvas. You don’t have to do anything.</dd>
      <dt>What happens if I miss a Friday deadline?</dt>
      <dd>Most weeks, nothing will happen. You still have the grace period so that you can turn in your work later. Check the table on page 6 of the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2022-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall22.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Short Guide to the Course</a> for a list of which assignments have a three-day grace period and which have an open grace period.<br>
        <br>
        The one Friday deadline that you should not miss is the end of the open grace period at 11:59 PM on Friday, December 2. You cannot submit work for the course after that time passes.
