<h2>General Questions</h2>
    <dl class="faq">
    <dt id="group">Which assignments are group-based? Are all or most projects group work or mostly individual?</dt>
    <dd>The groups in the course are focused solely on accountability. They are something like study groups, not collaborative writing groups. You use your group to check in on one another and help keep one another on track. Beyond that, there are no assignments for the group to complete.</dd>
        <dt id="relatewkpl">How do assignments relate to the workplace? Would my boss ask me for an analysis?</dt>
    <dd>You will write a range of documents in the workplace, from reports to short email messages. You will probably write documents in the workplace that use the same kinds of writing, like describing an object, giving someone instructions, and making a recommendation. You will do lots of analysis as well. You’ll often been asked questions like “Why is x better than y?” and “How does our product/service compare to our competitor’s?”</dd>
        <dt id="different">Are there five different projects or five things that combine into one project?</dt>
    <dd>There are five different projects, which are all outlined on the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2022-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall22.pdf#page=7" target="_blank">Sequence of Technical Writing Projects page</a> in the Short Guide. They do not combine.</dd>
        <dt id="build">Do projects build on one another?</dt>
    <dd>In the sense that your reliance on writing skills evolves, yes, there build upon one another. Your ability to design a strong and effective document should evolve. There is also a specific connection between the Pitch Presentation and the Recommendation Report. In your Pitch, you will propose the topic for your Recommendation Report.</dd>
        <dt id="start">How early do we need to start projects? How long do projects take?</dt>
    <dd>The schedule allows three weeks for most of the projects. The Recommendation Report is a longer document, and it lasts five weeks (not counting Thanksgiving break). Because everyone has different ways of writing, I can’t guess how long it will take you to write a project. I know that the Recommendation Report will take more time than the Food Label Analysis. Beyond that, you have to rely on your own sense of how you work. It doesn’t hurt to read the assignments and start thinking about your work as early as you can.</dd>
        <dt id="assigned">Are topics assigned?</dt>
    <dd>The general tasks are assigned, as explained on the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2022-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall22.pdf#page=7" target="_blank">Sequence of Technical Writing Projects page</a> in the Short Guide. You have the freedom to choose what you want to write about within those guidelines. For instance, for the Food Label Analysis, you have to examine a food or beverage label, but you get to decide what food or beverage you analyze. The best way to determine the general task and the choices you can make is to read each of the assignments.</dd>
        <dt id="examples">Are there examples for assignments?</dt>
    <dd>Usually. You’ll find examples linked in the Modules that cover the assignments and in the assignments themselves. I do not have student examples for every assignment. For example, the Food Label Analysis is a new assignment, so there are no examples for it. </dd>
        <dt id="cite">Do we need to cite sources? What format should we use?</dt>
    <dd>If you borrow words, phrases, images, audio, video or ideas, then yes, you ALWAYS need to cite your sources—and that is in any class, not just technical writing. Otherwise, you are <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/plagiarism/" target="_blank">plagiarizing</a>.
<ul><li>For your recommendation report, use the style that is appropriate for your career field. For instance, electrical engineers use IEEE, and biologists often use CSE.</li>
      <li>For other assignments, you can use the format that makes sense. For a borrowed image, for instance, you can include a credit line in the image caption or at the end of the document.</li>
      </ul>
      </dd>
        <dt id="number">Is there a certain number of textbook/content citations you keep an eye out for?</dt>
    <dd>No. I look for support for claims that are made in documents. If your document makes a claim that is not <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/plagiarism/#:~:text=What about “common knowledge”?" target="_blank">common knowledge</a>, I expect a citation. There’s no way to guess how many times that might happen in a document. It might not happen at all. It might happen frequently. The <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/quotations/" target="_blank">Quotations page from the Writing Center at UNC at Chapel Hill</a> provides advice on how to add support to your work.</dd>
        <dt id="peerreview">Will we be able to conduct peer review for our full draft assignments?</dt>
    <dd>I do not have a formal peer review system set up for this course. I’ve found students have a difficult time connecting in an asynchronous, online course because you’re never all in a classroom at the same time. I’ve always found challenges with folks who do not complete a peer review for someone else and people who wait until so close to the due dates that there’s not time for a peer review.<br>
      <br>
       Here are a these options: 
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li>Ask members of your Accountability Group if they are interested in peer review. If so, you can set up a system that works for your group members.</li>
            <li>Share your draft in one of the Optional Peer Review Discussions, and then give feedback to at least one other student who has posted a draft in that Discussion and has not received a response. You can think of these Discussions as a community share where you help one another out. I’ll get these Discussions set up this weekend (September 10–11).</li>
            <li>Make an appointment at the <a href="https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html" target="_blank">Writing Center</a>. They don’t do peer review, but you can ask them to help with any questions that you have about your work. Be sure to share the assignment and the related criteria with them so that they understand what you are working on.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
        <dt id="textbook">How does the textbook connect to the full drafts and try-its?</dt>
    <dd>Every task ultimately connects to the textbook. You will find details on the different kinds of writing and the design and composing strategies in the text. There are also examples throughout the textbook. You will frequently find references to page numbers and sections of the textbook listed in the assignments for full drafts and try-its.</dd>
    <dt id="grammar">Do you have any suggestions for improving my grammar and sentence structure?</dt>
    <dd>I know that writing can be intimidating. I don't want you to become distracted by grammar issues. Focus on communicating your message and accomplishing what you need to in your writing. Those goals are far more important than whether you make a minor grammar or punctuation error.<br>
      <br>
      For outside resources, I recommend these sources:
      <ul>
            <li>Get help from a tutor at the Writing Center. Visit <a href="https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html" target="_blank">https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html</a> for more information, and make an appointment at <a href="https://vt.mywconline.com/" target="_blank">https://vt.mywconline.com/</a>. </li>
        <li>Check Appendix Parts C and D in Markel and Selber (the class textbook). These appendixes cover grammar, punctuation, mechanics, and usage.</li>
        <li>Consult the various <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/" target="_blank">Tips and Tools pages</a> from the Writing Center at UNC at Chapel Hill.</li>
        <li>Complete courses from LinkedIn Learning that focus on writing skills. Here are some examples:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/grammar-foundations?u=57888345" target="_blank">Grammar Foundations</a></li>

<h2>Label Analysis</h2>
<dl class="faq">
    <dt id="ethical">I’m having a hard time finding ethical information on my label. What should I do?</dt>
    <dd>You can review details in Chapter 2 of Markel &amp; Selber, “Understanding Ethical and Legal Considerations,” for help. You will also find useful suggestions when you complete <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/quizzes/384457">Try-It #4: Ethics on Your Food Label</a>.
      <br>
    </dd>
    <dt id="package">Does the label mean just the nutrition facts on the back of the product or the whole package?</dt>
    <dd>You are examining the entire package—look for words, colors, images, and other features to consider how the package works as a technical document.</dd>
  </dl>
<h2>Recommendation Report</h2>
<dl class="faq">
    <dt id="rrtopic">What is the topic for the recommendation report?</dt>
    <dd>You will identify a food-related challenge that Virginia Tech students face, investigate solutions, and make a recommendation to your readers. See the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/pages/recommendation-report-topic" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Topic page</a> for more information.</dd>
        <dt id="rrformatting">Is the recommendation report single- or double-space? What font size and typeface? What is the format for projects?</dt>
    <dd>Your goal is to create an effective, professional report. Use the formatting that works best for your document. Check out “Figure 18.8: Sample Recommendation Report” in Markel &amp; Selber (beginning on page 502) to see what a report looks like. 
      Additionally, know that I do not obsess about things like a specific font or margin widths. I care about a document that looks professional. It should have an appearance that fits its purpose and content. It should pay attention to design principles, including contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. <br>
      <br>
      If a document has a different font typeface for every paragraph, I’m marking it Incomplete and sending it right back for revision because it would appear highly unprofessional because of its lack of consistency and repetition. On the other hand, a font typeface like Comic Sans and a design with speech bubbles and cartoon drawings might seem inappropriate for a formal report; however, it might make sense if your report was about creating a graphic novel or series of comic posters as part of an educational campaign. The bottom line: Use the formatting that makes sense and looks appropriate and professional.</dd>
        <dt id="rrfront">Does the requirement for front and back matter mean that the recommendation report is 10 to 15 pages, front and back?</dt>
    <dd>The front and back matter for a report are a specific portion of the document. It’s not a reference to the pages at all. The front matter includes things like the Letter of Transmittal and the Title Page. The back matter includes things like your list of references or bibliography. You’ll find more information on the front and back matter in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/assignments/1523131" target="_blank">Recommendation Report assignment</a> and related resources for that project.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Try-Its</h2>
    <dl class="faq">
        <dt id="ttime">About how much time or how many words do students typically put into try-its? </dt>
    <dd>I don’t count words or measure time. If it helps, the try-its are the kind of tasks that we would complete in class if we meet in the classroom, so generally, they would take up a class period. Don’t worry if it takes you more or less time. Some people write quickly. Some require more time. I care more about whether the activity is complete and fits the assignment. Focus on doing the work and not counting things.</dd>
        <dt id="tpurpose">Are try-its supposed to help to complete the full drafts or are they separate?</dt>
    <dd>Try-Its are separate activities that help practice skills and develop writing that will impact your full drafts. The full drafts are separate activities that relate to but are not the same as the try-its. See the next question for more details.</dd>
        <dt id="tconnect">How do the try-its connect to the full drafts?</dt>
    <dd> In some cases the try-its ask you to practice skills that you will use in your full draft. <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/assignments/1523841" target="_blank">Try-It #1: Analyzing a Technical Document</a> and <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/assignments/1524232" target="_blank">Try-It #3: Evaluating Food Label Photos</a> are examples of practicing skills. Other Try-Its ask you to gather ideas or write something that will become part of your full draft. <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/assignments/1533828" target="_blank">Try-It #4: Ethics on Your Food Label</a> is an example of gathering information that you can include in your full draft.</dd>
    <dt id="texamples">Can we see what a good answer for the &quot;Try-it&quot; quizzes would be?</dt>
    <dd>I’ve posted two examples for Try-It #4: <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/pages/try-it-student-example-number-1" target="_blank">Student Example #1</a> and <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/pages/try-it-student-example-number-2" target="_blank">Student Example #2</a>.</dd>
  </dl>
    <h2>Final Exam</h2>
    <dl class="faq">
        <dt id="optional">What is the final optional? What’s its purpose?</dt>
    <dd>The final exam lets you propose a course grade different from the grade indicated by looking strictly at the work you have earned a Complete on. If you are happy with the course grade you have at the end of the term, you don’t need to complete the final. The <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/pages/final-exam-preparation" target="_blank">Final Exam Preparation page</a> gives you some additional information.</dd>
        <dt id="release">When will the final project be released?</dt>
    <dd> The <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/pages/final-exam-preparation" target="_blank">Final Exam Preparation page</a> is live now. The exam itself, which includes the form for your final, opens at midnight on the first day of exams. This term that is at 12:00 AM on Friday, December 9, 2022. </dd>
