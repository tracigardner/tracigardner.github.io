        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;Will group members be assigned?</summary>
            <div style="padding-left: 40px;">
                Yes, groups were set up the second week of the course. They were based on your responses to the student information survey during the first week of class.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;How many members will be in each group?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                Groups are 4&ndash;5 members each.
            </div>

        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;Will you assign team leaders?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                No. I will ask groups to assign leaders. The best I could do is choose randomly. I ask you to choose so that you have someone willing and able to do the job.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;Are groups the same for all the group assignments?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                Yes, I want you to develop working collaboration, so more time with the same people will help you adjust to overcome any challenges.

        <h3 style="font-weight: bold;margin-top: 12px;border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41;">Assessment and Feedback</h3>
        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;Do the group projects have an impact on our course grades?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                Of course. You need to both participate fully in the group projects and earn a Complete on the group projects.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;Will everyone in the group get the same grade?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                The documents will either be marked Complete or Incomplete. Everyone in the group will receive the same mark. If the group project is Incomplete, the group can revise and resubmit as long at the end of the grace period has not passed.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;Is there a group-member grading system?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                This course has no grades other than the course grade at the end; therefore, there is no grading system. Group members will, however, have the opportunity to provide feedback on one another&rsquo;s work.
            </div>
        </details>


        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;How will poor or missing work from one group member impact the grade for the project?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                Remember that documents will either be marked Complete or Incomplete. Everyone in the group will receive the same mark. In the case of a group member who does not participate at all or participates only minimally, that person will receive an Incomplete.
            </div>

        <h3 style="font-weight: bold;margin-top: 12px;border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41;">Group Meetings and Collaboration</h3>
        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;Do we have to coordinate a time for meetings?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                You can if you want to. Your group will decide how you want to meet and work together. Here are some tips:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a shared Google calendar or use scheduling apps like Doodle or When2meet to find common meeting times.</li>
                    <li>Be flexible and accommodating of each other&rsquo;s schedules.</li>
                    <li>Use online communication tools like Canvas Discussions, Zoom, or Slack if physical meetings are not possible.</li>
                    <li>Assign a group member to be responsible for scheduling and reminders to keep everyone on track.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;Will there be any mandatory meetings set up?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                I will not set up mandatory meetings. Your group can however. The goal of the tasks is to learn about project management as it relates to collaborative writing. You need to make the decisions and evaluate how they work.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;How does a group project work in an asynchronous course?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                Your group can decide how to collaborate based on your schedules and what works best for you. You can meet in person or on Zoom. Your whole group can meet, and you can also have smaller meetings with two or three people. You can also use the resources in Canvas Discussions to connect.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;How many times a week do you recommend for groups to meet?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                I believe that groups will benefit from at least meeting once a week to arrange work, update one another, and address any challenges that come up. You can meet more than that if you want.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;Are we able to adjust the work schedule and group assignments after?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                Of course. Your group decides what kind of meetings and schedule work for everyone involved. You&rsquo;re in control.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;How will we contact group members?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                You can choose whatever will work best for the members of your group. Your group can exchange email addresses, and you can connect in Canvas Discussions. If you want, you can exchange cell numbers so you can text one another or set up a GroupMe for your group.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;How will the group share documents?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                I recommend Google Drive, primarily because it is what I use the most. If you are used to sharing work with Office 365, that&rsquo;s fine too. I just can&rsquo;t help much with Office because I haven&rsquo;t used it.

            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;How long will the group projects take?</summary>

            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;Will the group collaborate on projects, or will we each write our own report?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                These are group projects, so everyone will collaborate to write and submit a single document for each of the projects. For instance, your group will collaborate to write and submit a proposal.

            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;What Major Projects will we write as a group?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                The Major Projects are all listed in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/discussion_topics/1700429" target="_blank">How You&rsquo;ll Collaborate This Term Announcement</a>.

        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;Will each group member have a specific page count to complete?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                I won&rsquo;t set up any page counts. I don&rsquo;t set up page counts for the documents either. I give you a typical range that describes (but does not prescribe) the length. Length depends upon what you have to say, your document design, your use of graphics and illustrations, and other document elements.
            </div>
        </details>


        <details style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;How can we ensure work is evenly divided among group members?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">

                <ul>
                    <li>Set clear expectations at the beginning of the project. Discuss roles and responsibilities for each member, and make sure everyone agrees on their tasks.</li>
                    <li>Communicate openly with your group. If you&rsquo;re struggling or unable to contribute, discuss it with the group. If a member of the group is struggling, do what you can to support them. Rearrange tasks as a group if you need to.</li>
                    <li>Track your group progress and responsibilities so it's clear who is doing what. You can keep a running list of accomplishments in a Canvas Discussion thread.</li>
                    <li>Remember that the natural process of the work may mean that one person works more during one week than the others. For instance, the person who proofreads the entire document for consistency will have more to do at the end of the writing process.</li>
                </ul>

            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;What should groups do if a member does not respond to email or messages in Canvas?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                Your group can decide on the general methods when you begin collaborating. That might be a phone call to check on anyone who is missing. Start from assuming everyone means well, so check on people before the project. If you continue to be unable to contact the person, your group can contact me in Canvas Inbox.
            </div>

            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;When should we be concerned about a missing student?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                If someone is missing for a day, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it. Everyone has a bad day from time to time. If the person is missing a week or more, you definitely need to let me know.
            </div>

            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;What should groups do if a member does not contribute to the documents?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <ul>
                    <li>Your group can decide how to deal with this situation as well. For example, your group can negotiate with the person, outlining what they need to do to catch up.</li>
                    <li>Be sure that your group documents the situation as it happens. You need to have clear facts about what is doing on.</li>
                    <li>If you decide to contact me, the group members should all agree (except the member who is not contributing, of course). Once you all agree, send me one message from the group in Canvas Inbox. Be sure to also copy the message to group members, and include the documentation that you have on the situation in the message.</li>
                </ul>

            <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down" style="color: #861f41;"></i>&nbsp;How should groups deal with disagreements among members?</summary>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                Your group should work together to resolve any disagreements, as you will do in the workplace. Here are some things that will help:
                <ul>
                    <li>You&rsquo;ll create a Teamwork Agreement and Schedule during the first week of collaborative writing. In it, you&rsquo;ll indicate how you agree to resolve conflicts.</li>
                    <li>If conflicts persist, ask me for help. As a group send one Canvas Inbox message to me explaining the situation. Copy all your group members on the message.</li>
                </ul>
