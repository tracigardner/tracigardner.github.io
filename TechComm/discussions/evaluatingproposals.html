    <h1>Evaluating Proposals Discussion: The Community Garden Project</h1>
    <p>Before you can create a strong proposal, you need practice evaluating what makes one strong&mdash;or weak. This assignment is designed to help you do that.</p>

    <h2><strong><span style="color: #861f41;">Scenario</span></strong></h2>
    <p>You&rsquo;re part of a proposal evaluation team for a local neighborhood association. Your team has received three proposals to fund a community garden project. Unfortunately, the team can fund only <strong>one</strong> of the proposals.</p>
    <p>Your job is to carefully read all three proposals, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and decide which one deserves the funding. Then, you&rsquo;ll engage with one of your classmates to compare your decisions and reflect on their analysis.</p>

    <h2><span style="color: #861f41;"><strong>Assignment Objectives</strong></span></h2>
    <p>By completing this assignment, you will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Practice evaluating technical documents based on content quality, detail, and usability.</li>
        <li>Develop your skills in analytical writing and justification of decisions.</li>
        <li>Recognize and explain the differences between strong and weak proposal components.</li>
        <li>Provide constructive feedback to a peer using clear, respectful language.</li>
        <li>Apply critical thinking when comparing multiple solutions to a community issue.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><span style="color: #861f41;"><strong>Assignment Tasks</strong></span></h2>
    <p>This is a three-step assignment.</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #c64600;"><strong>Step 1: Read the Three Proposals Below</strong></span></h3>
    <p>All three proposals contain the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Project Overview</li>
        <li>Benefits</li>
        <li>Costs</li>
        <li>Total First-Year Cost</li>
        <li>Conclusion</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span style="color: #c64600;"><strong>Step 2: Post Your Own Analysis (300&ndash;400 words, Your original post)</strong></span></h3>
    <p>In your discussion post, do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>State which proposal you would choose to fund</strong> and explain your reasoning.</li>
        <li>Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal.</li>
        <li>Reflect briefly on what makes a proposal effective for a non-expert audience like your evaluation team.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Be sure to <strong>reference specific parts</strong> of each proposal in your post to support your evaluation.</p>
    <h3><strong><span style="color: #c64600;">Step 3: Reply to a Classmate (150&ndash;200 words, Your reply)</span></strong></h3>
    <p>After posting, respond to <strong>at least one classmate</strong>. Your reply should:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Respectfully agree or disagree with their analysis.</li>
        <li>Highlight any aspects you hadn&rsquo;t considered in your own evaluation.</li>
        <li>Suggest one improvement that could strengthen the proposal they selected.</li>
    </ul>
