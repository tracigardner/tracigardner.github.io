  <h2>The Task  </h2>
  <h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
  <p>Review  the webpages that outline the connections among the assignments in this course, and post a reply that tells me what you have questions about.  </p>
  <h3>Why  I Want You to Do It</h3>
  <p>I designed the sequence of assignments in this course to make the activities “busy work free.” The writing projects all relate to the culminating recommendation report. I am asking for feedback this week to make sure you understand the connections among the assignments. I want my goals for you to be transparent. I believe that if you understand why you are doing something you can do a better job reaching your goal.</p>
