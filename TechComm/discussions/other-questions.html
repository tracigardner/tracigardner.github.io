    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Collaborate with classmates in planning, researching, writing, revising, and presenting information. <strong>[<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 5]</strong></li>
      <li>Analyze your draft and find ways to improve your project using strategies related to technical writing <strong>[<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 1–7]</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Task </h2>
    <h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
    <p>Participate in this Discussion three times during the next three weeks (from April 12 to April 30). This activity gives you more choice than previous Discussions. You can do of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Post a question or comment about the Recommendation Report.</li>
      <li>Post a meme that relates to what you are working on for the course.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
    <p>One of the suggestions to improve feedback was to have a place where you can ask questions that come up that don't require you to post a draft. This forum lets you post those kinds of questions whenever they come up. </p>

          <li>A link that could help someone else with the project (with an explanation of what it is and why).</li>
          <li class="null">Anything else that seems relevant.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="skipline">Read over your message to make sure it’s clear, and make any changes you need to make sure your group understands your message.</li>
