  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Collaborate with classmates in planning, researching, writing, revising, and presenting information. <strong>[<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 5]</strong></li>
    <li>Analyze your draft and find ways to improve your project using  strategies related to technical writing <strong>[<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 1–7]</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Task  </h2>
  <h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
  <p>Participate in this Discussion three times during the next three weeks (from April 12 to April 30). This activity gives you more choice than previous Discussions. You can do of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Post a question or comment about the Recommendation Report.</li>
    <li>Post a meme that relates to what you are working on for the course.</li>
    <li>Post a link to a resource you have found that could help someone else with the project (with an explanation of what it is and why).</li>
    <li>Respond to any of those things that have been posted. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Why  I Want You to Do It</h3>
  <p>One of the suggestions to improve feedback was to have a place where you can ask questions that come up that don't require you to post a draft. This forum lets you post those kinds of questions whenever they come up. </p>
  <h3 id="how">How You  Do It  </h3>
  <ol class="skipline">
    <li class="skipline">Write a post, if you like. As noted above, you can post any of the following:

        <li>A meme that relates to what you are working on for the course.</li>
        <li>A link that could help someone else with the project (with an explanation of what it is and why).</li>
        <li class="null">Anything else that seems relevant.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="skipline">Read over your message to make sure it’s clear, and make any changes you need to make sure your group understands your message.</li>
    <li>Post your message. </li>
    <li>Check in by read through the posts at least twice a week (by Wednesday at 11: 59 PM and by Friday at 11: 59 PM).</li>
