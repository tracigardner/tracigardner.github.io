<h3><img src="../-images/memes/discussion-board-posts.png" width="476" height="326" style="float: right;margin-left: 12px;" alt="Example discussion board posts: Student: I love bread. Me: Joe, I agree with you! I love bread too. I liked the part when you said you loved bread. Great point!"/>What You Said</h3>
<p>I asked you to tell me what you would do or change to improve the Feedback Discussions. Here is a summary of the advice you gave me most often:</p>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>Modify when the work is due to encourage more timely feedback. There were various suggestions for how to change the timeline, such as earlier deadlines, no grace period, and more than one deadline.</li>
  <li>Provide more structure for the feedback, such as suggesting people provide both praise for good work and critiques on what could be improved. </li>
  <li>Encourage more specific questions about the drafts (rather than questions such as “How can I improve?”</li>
  <li>Require more specific feedback. Eliminate overly simple responses like “I agree” and “This is good.”</li>
  <li>Provide set guidelines for feedback so that there is a better idea of how to respond.</li>
  <li>Be sure that the questions are open-ended so that people have to say more than “yes” or “no.”</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Changes I’m Making in Response</h3>
<p>I cannot make every change that was suggested, so I am focusing on those that were mentioned most often and that should make the biggest difference for everyone.</p>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li><strong>12-hour  grace period</strong> on Feedback Discussions. </li>
  <li><strong>Feedback Discussions will be two parts</strong> for the Recommendation Report.
<ul>
      <li>Post your draft this week:
        <ul class="null">
          <li>Due by 11:59 PM on Friday, 04/16.</li>
          <li>Grace Period ends at 12:00 (Noon) on Saturday, 04/17.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Provide feedback next week:
        <ul class="null">
          <li>Due by 11:59 PM on Friday, 04/23.</li>
          <li>Grace Period ends at 12:00 (Noon) on Saturday, 04/24.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Recommendation Report dates have changed</strong> to allow more time for you to use the feedback you receive.
<ul class="null">
        <li>Due by 11:59 PM on Tuesday, 04/27.</li>
          <li>Grace Period ends at 11:59 PM on Friday, 04/30. This is the end of the Grace Period for all the Writing activities in the class.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Feedback will use the <strong>Peer Review system</strong> built into Canvas, which builds in more structure for the feedback and add guidelines for your response.
    <ul>
      <li>You will provide feedback to two people in  the course. Canvas does not have a way for me to connect you with two people in your current group automatically.</li>
      <li>You will compare the drafts you give feedback on to the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/recommendation-report-criteria" target="_blank">assignment criteria</a> in a rubric.</li>
      <li>You can learn more about the Peer Review system in the Canvas documentation:
        <ul class="null">
          <li><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Video-Guide/Feedback-Overview-Students/ta-p/383514" target="_blank">Feedback Overview</a> (video demonstration)</li>
          <li><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-know-if-I-have-a-peer-review-assignment-to-complete/ta-p/318">How do I know if I have a peer review assignment to complete?</a></li>

          </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Points </strong>for the Feedback Discussion will be earned in two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>For the week of April 12, Traci will add your points after you post your draft in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/assignments/1169679">Recommendation Draft Feedback Discussion</a>.</li>
      <li>For the week of April 19, you will claim your points when you complete the weekly self-assessment. Traci will confirm your points by checking that you submitted two peer reviews.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
