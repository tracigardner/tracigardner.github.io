Since we&rsquo;re going to be working together for the rest of the term, we should get to know one another.<br /><br />Everyone in your group will be able to read your answer, so please do not share any information that should be kept private.</p>
<ol class="skipline">
<li>As a way to tell us something about yourself, write a short biographical statement. Please let us know your preferred name and pronouns.</li>
<li>If you are unsure how to begin, consider one or more of these starting places, and tell us a story that explains something about who you are:
<ul>
<li>What is your major? What do you plan to do with your degree in the workplace? Tell us about your career goal(s). What inspired you to choose the career that you did?</li>
<li>What are you doing when you aren&rsquo;t studying or in class? Are you in clubs or Greek organizations? Do you have some hobbies? What do you like to do to stop thinking about classes? Why have you chosen the activities that you have? Why do they interest you?</li>
<li>What other things would you like us to know about you? Are you a veteran? a Member of the Corps? a Girl Scout or Boy Scout? an athlete? a cosplayer? a reader? a gamer? Why is what you&rsquo;re telling us important to you? Why would you like us to know it?</li>
<li>What experience reading and writing in the workplace do you have? Think of the word<span>&nbsp;</span><em>workplace</em><span>&nbsp;</span>broadly. You might have held a volunteer position or an internship, for instance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proofread your answer to ensure that everyone will understand what you say.</li>
<li>Feel free to include a photo of yourself or something you care about to your post. [I will go by your official photo in the VT system, which is usually a photo from your first-year orientation (whatever is on your Hokie Passport). If you want me to see a different image, here is your chance.]</li>
<li>After you post your introduction, read through the other self-introductions and reply if you want.</li>
</ol>
<p>Grading Process</p>
<p>You will claim points for this activity when you complete the Self-Assessment in Canvas.</p>
