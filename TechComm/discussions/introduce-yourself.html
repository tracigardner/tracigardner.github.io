    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><img style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 30px; float: right;" src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/intro-lolcat.png" alt="Lolcat introduces itself" width="269" height="492" />Collaborate with classmates in planning, researching, writing, revising, and presenting information. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 5] </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Task</h2>
    <h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
    <p>Introduce yourself to your group and me by writing a short introduction or recording an audio or video introduction.</p>
    <h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
    <p>Since we&rsquo;re going to be working together for the rest of the term, we should get to know one another. </p>
    <p>Additionally, we need to know how to pronounce your name and refer to you as we work together. Names and pronouns are important, and I want to be sure we work in mutual respect for one another.</p>
    <h3>How to Do It</h3>
    <ol class="skipline">
      <li>Choose how you want to introduce yourself:
        <ul class="null">
          <li>Write a short intro, including a photo if you’d like, with fewer than 400 words.</li>
          <li>Make a short audio recording that introduces yourself, lasting about 2–3 minutes.</li>
          <li>Record a short video introduction, lasting no more than 2–3 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        I won’t count words or track minutes. The length information is simply a guideline to help you understand how much information to share.
      </li>
      <li>Decide on the language and tone you want to use:
        <ul class="null">
          <li>You can use informal language, just as you would if you were chatting with someone on campus. </li>
          <li>Keep the language classroom friendly however.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Remember not to share any information that should be kept private since everyone in your group can see your answer.</li>
      <li>Compose a short biographical statement that includes:
        <ul class="null">
          <li>your preferred name </li>
          <li>your pronouns</li>
          <li>pronunciation notes for your name (for instance, I’m Traci, pronounced tray-see).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Tell us a story that explains something about who you are. You can use one of these questions as a starting place if you like:
        <ul>
          <li>What is your major? What do you plan to do with your degree in the workplace? Tell us about your career goal(s). What inspired you to choose the career that you did?</li>
          <li>What are you doing when you aren&rsquo;t studying or in class? Are you in clubs or Greek organizations? Do you have some hobbies? What do you like to do to stop thinking about classes? Why have you chosen the activities that you have? Why do they interest you?</li>
          <li>What other things would you like us to know about you? Are you a veteran? a Member of the Corps? a Girl Scout or Boy Scout? an athlete? a cosplayer? a reader? a gamer? Why is what you&rsquo;re telling us important to you? Why would you like us to know it?</li>
          <li>What experience reading and writing in the workplace do you have? Think of the word<span>&nbsp;</span><em>workplace</em><span>&nbsp;</span>broadly. You might have held a volunteer position or an internship, for instance.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Proofread your answer to ensure that everyone will understand what you say. </li>
      <li>After you post your introduction, read through, watch, or listen to the other self-introductions from your group, and reply if you want.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Grading Process</h2>
    <p>You will claim points for this activity when you complete the weekly self-assessment in Canvas.</p>
