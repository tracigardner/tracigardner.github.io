    <p>Remember that all workplace writing is meant to be persuasive in one way or another. In other words, any piece of writing that is public-facing&mdash;designed for public consumption&mdash;is meant to persuade the reader of something. A proposal attempts to convince its readers that the idea it covers is the best one possible. A recommendation report tells its readers &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the solution to your problem.&rdquo; Even a resume argues, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the best person for the job. Hire me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>For this discussion, find an example of technical or professional communication. This example could be a user manual, simple set of instructions, proposal, short report, government or business form, or even an assignment from another class. In other words, you can Google an example or select one from your personal experience. Don&rsquo;t overthink it.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #861f41;"><strong>Assignment Objectives</strong></span></h2>
    <p>This discussion has several objectives:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the rhetorical purpose, audience, context, and stakeholders of a technical or professional document.</li>
        <li>Analyze how effectively a document meets the needs of its intended audience using a reader-centered approach.</li>
        <li>Recognize and evaluate rhetorical strategies such as appeals to logic, authority, or usability.</li>
        <li>Practice giving and receiving constructive feedback in order to improve clarity, usability, and effectiveness in technical communication.</li>
        <li>Develop skills as a peer reviewer by asking thoughtful questions, offering revision suggestions, and engaging in meaningful dialogue with classmates. (You will be using these later!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><span style="color: #861f41;"><strong>Assignment Requirements</strong></span></h2>

    <p>Once you have read your example and thoroughly familiarized yourself with it, respond in a thoughtful discussion post to the questions listed below AND upload a copy of the document. Number your responses and attach or provide a link to your document. <strong>This will be your original post.</strong></p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">

No doc or link? <span>&nbsp;</span>-33 points (though you can revise if the Grace Period is still open).</strong></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="part2" style="font-size: 18pt;border-bottom: 1px solid #508590;color: #508590;"><strong>Part 2</strong></h2>
    <p>Respond thoughtfully to the post of a classmate by reviewing the document they have written about and answering the following questions. <strong>This will be your response post.</strong></p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>
            <p><strong>What part of your classmate&rsquo;s analysis did you find especially thoughtful or accurate? Why? Point to something specific in the document that supports their observation.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Do you see the audience, purpose, or context differently than your classmate does? If so, explain your thinking, using examples from the document to support your view. </strong><em>(It&rsquo;s okay to disagree as long as you're respectful and back up your ideas.)</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>What&rsquo;s one question you&rsquo;d like to ask your classmate about their document or their analysis? </strong><em>(For example: &ldquo;Why do you think the tone is effective for this audience?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How do you think the layout affects readability?&rdquo;)</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Suggest one small revision or improvement to the document that could make it more effective for the reader. Explain your reasoning. </strong><em>(Try to build on something your classmate already noticed or discussed.)</em></p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 style="color: #861f41;"><strong>Grading</strong></span></h2>
    <p>Check the rubric for full assessment criteria.</p>

    Once I add feedback, you’ll find comments in annotations on the document and in the rubric. Allow 3–4 days for me to add feedback.
