    <p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 12px 12px;" src="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/99222/files/10756526/download?wrap=1" alt="Text Alignment in Web Design" width="510" height="584" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/99222/files/10756526" data-api-returntype="File" />I have marked all of your Ethics Poster rough drafts complete (or incomplete if they are missing or didn’t meet the requirements of the assignment). In this Announcement, I&rsquo;ll comment on how you all did and what you can do to improve your projects.</p>
    <h2 style="color: #e87722;">Why Group Feedback?</h2>
    <p>As you may remember from the Course Manual, I use antiracist assessment strategies, adapted from Asao Inoue&rsquo;s work on <a href="https://www.academia.edu/12029467/Grading_Contracts_Assessing_Their_Effectiveness_on_Different_Racial_Formations">contract grading</a>, <a href="http://www.academia.edu/12027143/A_Grade-less_Writing_Course_that_Focuses_on_Labor_and_Assessing">labor-based grading</a>, and <a href="http://www.academia.edu/14213706/Antiracist_Writing_Assessment_Ecologies_Teaching_and_Assessing_for_a_Socially_Justice_Future">anti-racist assessment strategies</a>. </p>
    <p>The usual grading process of comparing student work to an ideal text means your success in a course depends upon perfect grammar and style. But whose grammar and style count? And who decides? That’s the problem. The ideal is systemically racist (and classist as well!) because it ignores the many ways that people communicate. </p>
    <p>In what we’ll call “real life,” no one speaks or writes according to a single “correct” grammar and style. In fact, there is no one “correct” way of communicating. There are many ways of communicating, and as long as your audience understands the message, those ways are “correct.” To be honest, I don’t like to talk about what is correct or incorrect. Your writing is either going to be effective or ineffective at accomplishing your goals.</p>
    <p>Too often, writers look at comments on their draft as a to-do list. They assume that a teacher marks out everything wrong with a draft <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>. In response, all they have to do is address all those little marks and they will “perfect” their submissions.</p>
    <p>You, as a writer, have to determine the best strategies to use to communicate effectively. You need to look at advice and expectations, choose those that will help your writing, and apply them to your work. </p>
    <p>y it asks writers to be responsible for improving their writing (rather than using comments like a to-do list that will </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 21px;" class="fn1"><a name="fn1" id="fn1"></a>[1] A large misconception in the first place. Teachers rarely mark each and every error in a text. Even if we had all the time in the world, marking every little thing is overwhelming for the student. Instead, most of us focus on one or two prominent higher order issues that can increase the text’s effectiveness.</p>
    <h2 style="color: #e87722;">General Feedback</h2>
    <p>Everyone receives one of the two comments listed in the bulleted list below. These comments simply state policies related to the assignment. There&rsquo;s no hidden meaning. I just want you to be aware of these policies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The grade on your draft indicates only that you turned in a draft. It does not reflect how well you have met the requirements of the assignment.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">This document was turned in after the deadline for feedback, so the grade only indicates completion of the activity. It is not a statement of how well the draft meets the requirements of the assignment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="color: #e87722;">Specific Feedback</h2>
    <ul>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Meet the requirements of the assignment.</strong> Make sure you include all 10 kinds of writing and all 11 columns. Be sure that you pay attention to the difference between columns and rows, explained on<a title="Analysis of Writing in Your Field" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/99222/pages/analysis-of-writing-in-your-field" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/99222/pages/analysis-of-writing-in-your-field" data-api-returntype="Page"> the assignment page</a>. Look at the <a title="Analysis of Writing Example" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/99222/pages/analysis-of-writing-example" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/99222/pages/analysis-of-writing-example" data-api-returntype="Page">example on the assignment page</a> to see a general idea of the expected layout.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Focus on a clear main point.</strong> Your title should tell the reader enough to know exactly what the document is about. Be sure that you are specific about the kind of career involved.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>asdfsadf</strong>.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Avoid centered text</strong>. Remember that the best design for text is flush left, ragged right. Centered text is harder to read. See <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/document-design/page--centered-text-is-harder-to-read.html">Centered Text Is Harder to Read</a><a title="#FridayFact: Centered Text Is Harder to Read" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/99222/discussion_topics/556924" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/99222/discussion_topics/556924" data-api-returntype="Discussion"></a>.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Work on document design:</strong> Many projects could be improved with more attention to document design.

      <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Help from the Writing Center:</strong>&nbsp;As a reminder, anyone can make an appointment with the Writing Center for help with projects for the course. Writing Center tutors can help you strengthen your content as well as work on document design and issues with phrasing, grammar, or punctuation. Appointments are online, so you don’t even have to be in Blacksburg. You can read more about the Writing Center and make an appointment on the&nbsp;<a href="https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Writing Center&rsquo;s webpage</a>.</li>
