<h2>How to Complete Your Log Entries</h2>
<p>This information  explains how to fill out your log entries each week. You will log your work,  noting what you do, how long you work, and how hard you worked. </p>
<p>Submitting your weekly labor log does two things:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>It allows you to keep track of your progress in the class, making sure you are up-to-date on your work.</li>
  <li>It allows me to learn what is working well for you and where you may need more support.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the  term, you can use your logs to write a performance review (your final exam) that explains what you have accomplished overall and provides a self-evaluation  of your work in the course.</p>
<h2>Log of Your Weekly Work</h2>
<p>You are graded on  the work you do, so this log is critical to doing well because it tells me what  work you do each week. I look for strong details and reflections on the various  tasks you complete each week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For all the work  that you complete, add a line to your log with specific information about the  work that you did. The log pages for each week include the headings shown  below:</p>
<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
  <table style="vertical-align: top;border: 1px solid #861F41;border-collapse: collapse;">
    <tr style="text-align: left;vertical-align: top;">
      <th style="border: 1px solid #861F41;padding: 6px;"><p>Date</p></th>
      <th style="border: 1px solid #861F41;padding: 6px;"><p>Time Spent</p></th>
      <th style="border: 1px solid #861F41;padding: 6px;"><p>Intensity</p></th>
      <th style="border: 1px solid #861F41;padding: 6px;"><p>Kind of Work (Reading, Writing, Feedback, Tracking, Other)</p></th>
      <th style="border: 1px solid #861F41;padding: 6px;"><p>Description &amp; Reflection</p></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #861F41;padding: 6px;"><p>&nbsp;</p></td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #861F41;padding: 6px;"><p>&nbsp;</p></td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #861F41;padding: 6px;"><p>&nbsp;</p></td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #861F41;padding: 6px;"><p>&nbsp;</p></td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #861F41;padding: 6px;"><p>&nbsp;</p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>Under each of these  headings, I expect to find the following information:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Date:</strong>  Just the numbers will work (e.g., 07/08)</li>
  <li>Time Spent: Estimate the number of minutes or hours. Don&rsquo;t stress about precision. A range will work here       (e.g., 5–10 mins.)</li>
  <li>Intensity: Use a word or two to explain how hard you worked. You can plan the words you will use so you can be       consistent. </li>
  <li>Kind of Work: Indicate the category that your work falls under, using the descriptions in the &ldquo;Kinds of Work in the Course&rdquo; section below. </li>
  <li>Description &amp; Reflection: Explain exactly what you did and why you did it. Use clear and specific details that show me the work that you put in. Here&rsquo;s an example:</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>DON&rsquo;T: Wrote my self-introduction. <br>
      That is probably accurate, but it doesn&rsquo;t show the work that went into what you did.</li>
    <li>DO: Jotted out the details I wanted to cover. Rearranged the details into an informal outline. Wrote a rough draft in Piazza. Reread the draft, and added a few details. Double-checked spelling and grammar, and then posted my work.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can also break those tasks out info separate lines in your log. In  other words, &ldquo;Jotted out the details I wanted to cover. Rearranged the details  into an informal outline.&rdquo; could be one entry in the log, and you might add a  reflection comment on why you adopted this strategy</p>

<h2>Summary Comments &amp; Reflections on  the Week</h2>
<p>At the end of the  week, review all of the entries that you have recorded, and write a summary  that synthesizes the work you have done during the week. Once you have your  summary written, reflect on what you have accomplished. You can consider  questions like these to get started:</p>

<ul type="disc">
  <li>What went well this week and why? </li>
  <li>Conversely, what challenges did you encounter and why? How did you overcome them?</li>
  <li>What can you apply from this week in the future?</li>
  <li>What will you try differently next week and why?</li>
  <li>What questions do you have about your work this week?</li>
</ul>

<p>You don't need to  answer every question in your reflection. Just put in your best effort and  answer the questions that make sense for this week.</p>
<h2>Kinds of Work in the Course</h2>
<p>Use these details on the  different kinds of work in the class to categorize the work you do under the  &ldquo;Kind of Work&rdquo; column in your log.</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>The reading work in this course  is much like that in any other course you take. Examples of the things you will  read in this course include the following:&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>The writing work in this course relates to both the projects and class activities that you work on and to the  class communication and general class discussions. Examples of the writing you will do in the projects for this course include the following:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Tracking &amp;  Reflecting</h3>
<p>The tracking and reflecting work in this course focuses on the process of recording the various kinds of work  that you do in your Weekly Work Log and your Weekly Self-Assessments.&nbsp;  Examples of the tracking and reflecting you will do include the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Logging the different kinds of work that you do in the course</li>
  <li>Summarizing your accomplishments for the week</li>
  <li>Reflecting on which tasks went well and which were more challenging</li>
