<p>All too often, students email their professors in ways that do the exact opposite of what the student intended. Typically, when students email me, they want something. They might need more time on an assignment. They might want to ask about a class activity that they can’t figure out. They might want to let me know about a personal issue that will impact their work in the course (like an illness, an accident, or even a weather issue like a hurricane or a blizzard). </p>
<p>Whatever specific reason they are writing, they will all have one general goal: to persuade me (the reader) to help them or do something for them. They want to have a positive impact. They certainly don’t want to damage my impression of them in a way that might affect their progress in the course.</p>
<p> If you missed work at the beginning of the term, don&rsquo;t ask me if you can go back and make it up during the last week of the term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember to consider these important characteristics of your reader, even when you are writing a simple email message:<br>
  Who are your readers?<br>
  Why is your audience reading your document?<br>
  What are your reader’s attitudes and expectations?<br>
  How will your readers use your document?</p>
<p>(from Markel, Chapter 5, “Analyzing Your Audience and Purpose”)<br>
  Analyzing Your Audience and Purpose</p>
<p>Example 1: No, Nothing at All<br>
  To: Traci<br>
  From: Clueless<br>
  I wish to apologize for my absence.  I was sick. Is there anything that I need to make up?<br>
  Sassy Response I Wish I Could Send<br>
  No, nothing to make up. When we saw you hadn’t arrived yet, we played games on our phones for a while, but when we realized you weren’t going to show up, we just all logged off so you wouldn’t miss anything.</p>
<p>Example 2: Sure, I’ll Do the Work<br>
  To: Traci<br>
  From: Stomach Flu<br>
  I went to the health center this morning, as suggested by my RA. I have been sick for the past week. If I need to show you the the doctor's slip, please let me know.<br>
  Sure, let’s prolong this email exchange. I’ll write back and ask for what you should have sent with your excuse.</p>
<p>Example 3a: TMI<br>
  To: Traci<br>
  From: Bumpy Day<br>
  I have caught some sort of virus from my roommate. Normally, I would be able to come to class no problem, but I have these red bumps all over my hands and face and I don't want to get anyone else sick and it is embarrassing to say the least. If I could be excused from class tomorrow I would be very grateful. </p>
<p>Example 3b: TMI<br>
  To: Traci<br>
  From: The Runner<br>
  I will be missing class today, I apologize for my late notice.  I thought I would be fine from my stomach ache last night, but after my first class today I had to rush to the bathroom and decided I should just walk back home.  Not trying to be vulgar but I have diarrhea and do not wish to run in and out of the classroom.</p>
<p>Example 3c: TMI<br>
  To: Traci<br>
  From: The Morning After<br>
  I have been vomiting all night. It’s a little better now because I think there’s nothing left in my stomach. I don’t think I should come to class though.<br>
  Just keep the messy details to yourself. Say you’re sick. Say you have a cold or the flu. Say you’ve been to the doctor. But PLEASE don’t describe your every symptom.</p>
<p>Example 4: Don’t Ask Permission<br>
  To: Traci<br>
  From: Missing Something<br>
  OH MY GOODNESS! Please allow me to turn in my In-Class writing late. Is there anyway i can just email it to you like right now!I just cannot afford a zero on top of everything else I've been dealing with this week. PLEASE email me back ASAP with what I can do.</p>
<p>Yes, you can email it right now. It’s called an attachment. And calm down on the panic please.</p>
<p>Example 5: Having Priorities<br>
  To: Traci<br>
  From: You Aren’t My Priority<br>
  I know the first assignment is due today. However, I've been tied up with a large programming project this week as well as the Job fair today. I just haven't really been invested in the first assignment, and I know that should change. But for now, I have to turn it in at some point later.<br>
</p>
<p>Don’t even. Just don’t ever send something like this.</p>
<p>Example 6: Nothing’s Free<br>
  To: Traci<br>
  From: No Space<br>
  I wanted to let you know I will not be in class today. I made the mistake of switching up my parking pass with my roommate, so when i arrived on campus around 2:25 and realized I tried to find a free parking spot, but couldn’t. By the time I was able to drive home, wait for the bus, and arrive at class I’d have most likely already missed half of it. </p>
<p>Um, okay, that’s more drama than I need to know about.</p>
<p>Example 7: Emotional Exclamations<br>
  To: Traci<br>
  From: The Demander<br>
  I’m a student in your class and I need higher grade!!  My roommates keep pranking me so i can’t get my work done.  I try but it’s not working and it’s not my fault. :( :( :(<br>
  YOU MUST GIVE ME AN A+ NOW! IT’S VERY IMPORTANT!!! You are my only hope. I must have a better grade!!!!! </p>
<p>Do I look like Obi-wan to you? </p>
<p>What You Should Email<br>
  Write a clear, descriptive subject line.<br>
  Tell me who you are and what class you are in.<br>
  Keep excuses to a minimum.<br>
  Tell me how you will fix whatever needs fixed.<br>
  Attach or  link to anything you want to give me.<br>
  If you need something, ask for it clearly. </p>
