      <p>Because of technical difficulties with the Google LTI that was used for this process, the system we are using for the Weekly Work Logs changed, beginning on March 9, 2021. Work due prior to the 9th, uses this process. Work after the 9th will use the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank">Updated Instructions for Logs</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reflect on the work that you do, noting how you change and improve your writing strategies during the term.</li>
      <li>Gather details that you will use later in the term, when you consider your overall progress in the course..</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Task</h2>
    <p>Refer to this general overview of the Work Log process you’ll complete each week as needed. Specific templates will be posted in the module each week.</p>
    <h3>What I Want You to Do </h3>
    <p>Every week you will track the work that you do for the course in all four of the categories of kinds of work (Reading, Writing, Discussing, and Tracking). Your log will note.what you do, how long you work, and how hard you worked. </p>
    <h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
    <p>Submitting your weekly labor log does two things:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>It allows you to keep track of your progress in the class, making sure you are up-to-date on your work.</li>
      <li>It allows me to learn what is working well for you and where you may need more support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are graded on the work you do, so this log is critical to doing well because it tells me what work you do each week. At the end of the term, you can use your logs to write a performance review (your final exam) that explains what you have accomplished overall and provides a self-evaluation of your work in the course.</p>
    <h3>How to Do It</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Weekly Work Log Assignment in the Module for the current week. </li>
      <li>Add the relevant details to the embedded Google Doc, outlining the work that you have done for the week. The log pages for each week include the headings shown below:
        <img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/work-log-google.png" width="800" height="365" alt="Screenshot from the Google Doc template for Work Logs" style="border: 1px solid #dcdcdc;margin-top: 12px;margin-left: 75px;margin-bottom: 12px;" />
        <p style="margin-top: 9px;">Under each of these headings, include the following information:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li><strong>Date:</strong>  Just the numbers will work (e.g., 01/25)</li>
          <li><strong>Time Spent:</strong> Estimate the number of minutes or hours. Don&rsquo;t stress about precision. A range will work here (e.g., 5–10 mins.)</li>
          <li><strong>Intensity</strong>: Use a word or two to explain how hard you worked. You can plan the words you will use so that your logs are consistent during the term. </li>
          <li><strong>Kind of Work:</strong> Indicate the category that your work falls under, using the descriptions of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJg9RoMQ31UQRcPeZuLFjGFjG25uosrG5AFw2IeW2c8/edit#heading=h.aoavw076fhnx" target="_blank">&ldquo;Kinds of Work&rdquo; in the Course Manual</a>. </li>
          <li><strong>Description &amp; Reflection:</strong> Explain exactly what you did and why you did it. Use clear and specific details that show me the work that you put in. Here&rsquo;s an example:</li>
          <ul type="circle">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">DON&rsquo;T: Wrote my self-introduction. <br>
              That is probably accurate, but it doesn&rsquo;t show the work that went into what you did.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">DO: Jotted out the details I wanted to cover. Rearranged the details into an informal outline. Wrote a rough draft in Piazza. Reread the draft, and added a few details. Double-checked spelling and grammar, and then posted my work.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that you can also break those tasks out info separate lines in your log. In other words, &ldquo;Jotted out the details I wanted to cover.&rdquo; could be one entry in the log, and you might add a reflection comment on why you adopted this strategy</p>
      </li>

      <li>At the end of the week, review all of the entries that you have recorded, and write a summary that synthesizes the work you have done during the week. Once you have your summary written, reflect on what you have accomplished. You can consider questions like these to get started:
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>What went well this week and why? </li>
          <li>Conversely, what challenges did you encounter and why? How did you overcome them?</li>
          <li>What can you apply from this week in the future?</li>
          <li>What will you try differently next week and why?</li>
          <li>What questions do you have about your work this week?</li>
        </ul>
        You don't need to answer every question in your reflection. Just put in your best effort and answer the questions that make sense for this week.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
    <p>You track and grade your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following task:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Claim points for tracking your work when you complete the Weekly Self-Assessment in Canvas. </li>
    </ul>
