 </figure>A progress report tells stakeholders the current status of a project, focusing on the accomplishments that have been made to date. </p>
<p>You might write a progress report at specifically decided points as you work on a project, such as the beginning, middle, and end of the work. In other cases, you might write a regularly scheduled progress report at the end of every week.</p>
<h2>Audience
</h2>
<p>In the workplace, the audience for your progress report might be your supervisor, others in management, and/or a client and other stakeholders. In the case of public initiatives, the audience can include any member of the public. </p>
<p>The information shared with an internal audience, like your supervisor or team, may differ significantly from that which you share with an external audience, like your client. For example, your supervisor or team might need details on how you are managing the work within the company. Are you doing the work yourself? Have you outsourced it to another person in the company? Your client doesn’t necessarily need this level of detail however. She probably doesn’t need to know that Jennifer in Procurement has obtained the widgets you need so the project should meet the next milestone on time. She simply needs to know what has been accomplished and whether the project is still on track. </p>
<h2>Ethical Issues</h2>
<p>Ethical considerations are an important part of progress reports. Everything that you include should be honest and clear. Stakeholders will use the information you provide to make decisions throughout their organization. Glossing over problems or failing to admit setbacks will not provide readers the information that they need and could conceivably harm business.
