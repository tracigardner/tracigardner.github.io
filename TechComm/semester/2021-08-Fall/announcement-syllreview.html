    <p>I have replied to all of the Syllabus Review activities that were submitted by Sunday afternoon. I noticed some questions that several people asked, so I am sharing those questions and the answers below.</p>
    <p>If you have a question that isn‚Äôt answered here, you can add it as a comment. If it‚Äôs a private question, just send me a message.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px;border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41;">&nbsp;</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>How can I address worries about time management, falling behind, etc.?</dt>
      <dd>Schedule this class as if it were synchronous. Choose a time slot that works for you (like 11 AM MWF), put it in your calendar so that you get reminders, and do work during that time period. Don't leave it for &quot;when you have time.&quot; That typically causes the most trouble if you forget or get busy.</dd>
      <dt>What can I do to ensure that the openness of the Grace Period doesn‚Äôt backfire? What if I slack off because I know there‚Äôs more time?</dt>
      <dd> I urge you to consider the suggested due dates as hard deadlines. Don't rely on the grace period unless you really need it because you are sick or have 18 exams in one week or something. In other words, don‚Äôt plan to be a slacker üòÅ</dd>
      <dt>Are the due dates just like fillers to show where in the course we should be at and then everything is due on December 3rd, except those specific activities like work logs?</dt>
      <dd>They could be seen as fillers, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. If you leave everything until December 3, you're going to be a very stressed-out Hokie (and unlikely to produce your best work). The suggested due dates are my strong suggestion for where you should be to stay on track. Wiggle room is there if you need it, but try for a few days rather than weeks.</dd>
      <dt>How does the Late Policy work when there are no grades?</dt>
      <dd>It doesn't do anything like drop your grade. Instead, you either do the work or you don't, so it's marked complete or incomplete. If you don't try, I'm going to assume you aren't putting in your best effort (unless I know about some problematic situation that came up, like being sick). </dd>
      <dt>Can I just skip the work since there‚Äôs no grade? </dt>
      <dd>In this course putting in your best effort means trying the projects. You don‚Äôt have to do a perfect job, but you have to attempt the activities and work to improve. If you decide not to write any of the projects, you're definitely <strong>not</strong> going to get me to agree that you have done A level work. As long as you are trying though, you'll be fine. </dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>If you're looking to see how much time and effort we put into our work how can a week with no work not affect us in the end. </dt>
      <dd>I don‚Äôt add up the time you spend on things. If you skipped a week for some reason (like maybe you were sick), I would expect to see you put in more work in the next week or two to catch up. There's no reason that a minor blip, like getting sick, should torpedo your grade in the course. If you just disappear and aren‚Äôt trying, sure, that would hurt you. As long as you are trying though, you'll be fine.</dd>
      <dt>How do the two rounds of peer feedback work? Do I have to do both of them?</dt>
      <dd>The idea of two rounds is more to help people who are working more slowly. Nearly all students I've had either choose the first round or the second-chance round. I don't remember anyone trying both, but you can. You do provide feedback to 2 other people whenever you participate (but you get feedback from 2 people too).
        The activity is essentially the same. It's just the time frame that changes.</dd>
      <dt>Can you share some example topics for the Recommendation Report?</dt>
      <dd>Sure. There is a huge range. Some examples are the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Making a place accessible (like where there is no wheelchair access)</li>
          <li>Improving recycling systems</li>
          <li>Implementing a small-scale solar system to a small cabin</li>
          <li>Improving website functionality or accessibility</li>
          <li>Adding sidewalks where there are none to improve safety</li>
          <li>Choosing sustainable materials for construction</li>
          <li>Changing a process to make it safer.</li>
          <li>Conserving wildlife or a specific habitat</li>
        </ul>
        Note that whatever you choose, you need to make it more specific than those listed. For instance, not conserving all the fish in the world, but a specific species in a specific location. Remember that your topic should be something that you can actually go out and see. If you‚Äôre in Blacksburg, saving giant otters in Peru isn‚Äôt going to work.
      </dd>
      <dt>If there are no grades, how can I tell how incorrect my work is? How can I tell where I stand?</dt>
      <dd>You should be able to tell by the feedback you get. The big thing would be whether you tried to fix it in the revision. Improving is what matters. I think it will make more sense as you start getting feedback.</dd>
