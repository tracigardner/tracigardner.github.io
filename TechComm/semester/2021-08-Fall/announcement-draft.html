<p>Announcement Draft</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biggest surprise: Studying at the Blacksburg Public Library. I had no idea so many students went there.</p>
<p>Biggest challenge: So many references to Starbucks! I have been stuck at home for so long because of the pandemic. My doctor doesn’t want me out in the world. And now, I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY want my Venti Caramel Mocha. And if I can get a Pumpkin Scone too, I’m not gonna complain. Maybe one day I will be able to leave the house again.</p>
<p>Question I wish I asked: I keep seeing people ask on the /r/VirginiaTech about quiet places they can zoom between classes. </p>
