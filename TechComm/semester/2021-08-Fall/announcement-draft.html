        <dt>Technical Issues with Your Work Log?</dt>

        <dt>Broken Link?</dt>
        <dd>Email tengrrl@vt.edu, or contact me through Canvas. Include the page you were on and the link that isn&rsquo;t working.</dd>

<h3 style="color: #861f41;">About the Best Place . . . Discussions</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Biggest surprise</dt>
        <dd>Studying at the Blacksburg Public Library. I had no idea so many students went there. When I was an undergrad, I would go to the public library too. They often had resources I needed (like general magazine articles), and the parking and access were so much easier.<br>
<br>
</dd>
        <dt>Biggest challenge</dt>
        <dd>So many references to Starbucks! I have been stuck at home for so long because of the pandemic. My doctor doesn&rsquo;t want me out in the world. And now, I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY want my Venti Caramel Mocha. And if I can get a Pumpkin Scone too, I&rsquo;m not gonna complain. Maybe one day I will be able to leave the house again.<br>
<br>
</dd>
        <dt>Question I wish I asked</dt>
        <dd>I keep seeing people ask on the /r/VirginiaTech about quiet places they can zoom between classes.</dd>

<p>I will begin reading and responding to your comments on the Syllabus Review this afternoon. Watch for responses in the next day or so.</p>
<h3 style="color: #861f41;">Weekend Responses</h3>
<p>I take weekends off as much as I can. If you send an email or message in Canvas, look for a response by Monday.</p>
