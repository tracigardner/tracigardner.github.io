        <p>Virginia Tech&rsquo;s motto, <em>Ut Prosim</em> (That I May Serve) is not just part of the university logo; it is a guiding principle that shapes how Hokies approach learning, research, and professional life. This semester-long writing project is designed in that spirit.</p>

        <p>Over the course of this term, you will research, write, and design a series of interconnected documents about a subject rooted in your major that serves others and contributes to the greater good. Each assignment builds toward your ability to explain a complex topic clearly and accessibly to different real-world audiences, always with the goal of informing, guiding, or supporting action that contributes to fairness, accessibility, and the well-being of communities.</p>

        <p>This page explains the focus of the project and introduces each of the six major projects.</p>

        <h2>Project Focus: Writing that Serves Others</h2>
        <p>You get to choose the subject on which you will focus your work this semester. The caveat is that it must be a technical object, practice, or idea within your field that has the potential to create a positive social impact. In the spirit of <em>Ut Prosim</em>, your topic should be:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Grounded in your major or area of study.</li>
            <li>Clearly connected to community service, problem-solving, or public good.</li>
            <li>Feasible to research and explain to multiple non-expert audiences.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Examples include the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Accessible design standards for public websites.</li>
            <li>Water purification systems for underserved areas.</li>
            <li>Renewable energy solutions for communities with limited resources.</li>
            <li>Assistive technologies that promote independence.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You&rsquo;ll explore this subject from multiple angles, starting with identifying and proposing your topic, then explaining it in depth, supporting real-world use, and finally communicating it clearly to the general public. This approach will allow you to develop professional-level skills in research, audience awareness, plain language writing, and visual communication. Further, by taking on a project that aims to serve, you&rsquo;ll be practicing the Virginia Tech motto: using your expertise not only for professional growth, but also to make a difference.</p>

        <h2>How the Assignments Work Together</h2>
        <h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Document 1: Subject Selection Email</h3>

            <li>Reporting concisely and objectively to a professional audience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Document 5: Informational Report for Non-Expert Readers</h3>

        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To present your research findings in a detailed, engaging report for local decision-makers.</p>

        <p>This report explains what your subject is, how it works, who developed it, and why it matters. You&rsquo;ll also explore how it addresses community needs and where future growth may lead. The audience might be a town council, nonprofit board, or school leadership team interested in ways to improve lives. This assignment directly supports <em>Ut Prosim</em> by helping leaders make informed decisions for the good of their communities.</p>

        <p>You&rsquo;ll develop these skills (among others):</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Technical explanation for a non-expert audience.</li>
            <li>Research synthesis and ethical citation.</li>
            <li>Use of visual aids (including data visualizations).</li>
            <li>Audience-focused organization and tone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Document 6: Fact Sheet</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To translate key findings from your report into a one-page document for the public.</p>

        <p>This highly visual document targets the community members served by the decision-makers in your report. Using plain language, accessible design, and key takeaways, your fact sheet will educate or inform readers about how the subject can affect their lives or help their communities. In this way, you are putting <em>Ut Prosim</em> into action by offering practical knowledge that serves others.</p>

            <li>Public communication and engagement strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
        <p>By the end of the semester, you&rsquo;ll have created a complete portfolio of technical writing artifacts, all centered around one subject from your field with the potential to serve others. You&rsquo;ll have communicated that subject across a variety of professional genres, for multiple audiences, and in multiple formats. You&rsquo;ll gain experience not only in technical communication, but also in writing that makes a positive difference.</p>
        <p>This project is about using your skills to live out the Virginia Tech motto, <em>Ut Prosim</em>, by doing good work for good reasons. As you research and write, keep asking:</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 2rem;margin-left: 24px;">Who benefits from this work? How can I help them understand and use it better?</p>

        <p>Your audience&mdash;and your community&mdash;are counting on you.</p>
