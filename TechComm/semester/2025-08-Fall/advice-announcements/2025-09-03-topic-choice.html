        <p style="font-size: 15px;">This week, you will begin by selecting a topic that you will research and write about over the course of the semester. Through five additional assignments beyond this brief subject-selection message&mdash;the research proposal, user document, progress report, informational article for non-expert readers, and fact sheet&mdash;you will return to your chosen subject, exploring it from different angles and in different genres. Because this course highlights the ways technical writing connects to our university motto of <em>Ut Prosim</em>, your topic should be one that touches on real ways to serve others, whether ecological, health-related, educational, or another area that shapes people&rsquo;s everyday lives.</p>
        <h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><em>Ut Prosim</em> in Your Hometown?</strong></span></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">When you think of <em>Ut Prosim</em> (That I may serve) don&rsquo;t limit yourself. Service also takes shape in the quieter, everyday, &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; work of proposal writers, report writers, designers, and researchers who help decision-makers and community members understand issues that affect them where they live. This kind of writing focuses on real needs and plays a key role in shaping the choices communities make about their future.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">While you are not required to focus on a real town, city, or county, I encourage you to consider your own hometown or home county as you choose a subject. Doing so allows you to ground your work in a place you know, making the topic more relevant and meaningful. It may even open the door to talking with people who are directly connected to the issue. Imagine conducting interviews that can bring authentic voices and real-world insight into your project! By starting close to home, you can discover how technical writing connects to the lives and concerns of the communities around you.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 15px;">For example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re from Arlington, VA. What sorts of public service-related topics are relevant there? In terms of environmental concerns, the county has already begun several watershed restoration projects, including those at Four Mile Run and the magnolia bog at Barcroft Park [1]. If you&rsquo;re interested in the environment (regardless of your major), you might select another spot you know of that could use such attention and write about it. Or say that your major is education. Are you familiar with the Phoebe Hall Knipling Outdoor Laboratory (aka, the Arlington Outdoor Lab), which teaches urban elementary-high school students hands-on environmental education in an outdoor setting of 331 acres [2]? Perhaps that example inspires you to research the possibility of other types of hands-on alternative educational environments.</p>
        <h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Finding Your Topic Using AI</strong></span></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">If you&rsquo;re not interested in working with a topic relevant to your hometown, you can select a generic subject from among those listed on the <a target="_blank" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/pages/report-subject-ideas-by-major">Report Subject Ideas by Major</a> page or come up with a different one.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">Say, though, that you <em><strong>are</strong></em> interested in focusing your work on an idea from your hometown, but you&rsquo;re just not sure of what topics might be relevant. How the heck are you supposed to be that linked in to such issues?</p>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">Remember that one way you can use AI in this course is for conducting research, which is precisely how we found the two examples I discuss above! (FYI: We used ChatGPT.) If you want to do similar research using AI, please consider a prompt like this one:</p>

        <pre style="padding: 9px 40px;font-size: 15px;">Please identify 2 or 3 real-life topics relevant to Arlington, VA, in the following areas: ecological, heath, food access, education. You can include any other areas that have the potential to create a positive social impact you can think of, too. The areas must be clearly connected to community service, problem-solving, or the public good.</pre>

        <p style="font-size: 15px;">This is a &ldquo;free&rdquo; use of AI. You don&rsquo;t have to submit paperwork to research using AI, but you DO have to make sure that the sources are legit! Go to them; search for the info. If you don&rsquo;t find it, move to the next citation. NEVER accept an AI-generated source as real unless you check it for yourself.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">You can also customize the <a title="Ut Prosim Project Ideas Prompt" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/pages/ut-prosim-project-ideas-prompt" data-course-type="wikiPages" data-published="true" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/216149/pages/ut-prosim-project-ideas-prompt" data-api-returntype="Page"><em>Ut Prosim</em> Project Ideas Prompt</a> to ask for topics related to your hometown or county.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">To sum up: The entire project is designed to let you develop your tech writing skills across several different genres while you research real-world issues. The most exciting part? If you choose a real entity in a real town, city, or county, there is always a possibility you can end up submitting your user document, report, and fact sheet to it for distribution.</p>
