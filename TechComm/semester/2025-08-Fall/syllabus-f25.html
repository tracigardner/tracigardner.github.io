        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/syll-images/writer-in-office.png" alt="a young technical writer working at a desk in an open office building" style="float: right;width:300px;height:300px;margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;"><strong>English 3764: Technical Writing</strong> will enable you to gain an understanding of the theories, issues, and practices of technical communications you might encounter in the workplace, such as general correspondence, proposals, reports, and presentations.</p>

        <p>From a foundation based on the principles of rhetoric, you will learn to analyze writing situations, consider the needs of your audience, assemble evidence, and design final documents that are user-friendly and visually persuasive. By the time this course is over, you should be able to understand these documents and produce them with ease and confidence.</p>


        <h3>Focus for Course Major Projects</h3>

        <p>In addition to quizzes, discussions, and homework, you will produce <strong>six interconnected documents</strong> on a subject rooted in your major that serves others and contributes to the greater good (an <em>Ut Prosim</em> project). The two pages below explain the projects and suggest topics if you don&rsquo;t already have one.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 1.5rem;text-align: center;"><a title="Semester-Long Project Overview: Writing with Ut Prosim in Mind" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/pages/semester-long-project-overview-writing-with-ut-prosim-in-mind" data-course-type="wikiPages" data-published="true" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/216149/pages/semester-long-project-overview-writing-with-ut-prosim-in-mind" data-api-returntype="Page">Semester-Long Project Overview: Writing with Ut Prosim in Mind</a></p>

        <h3>Use of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/syll-images/AI square-maroon.png" alt="AI-eligible logo, indicating that you can use AI for an assignment." style="float: right;margin: 0 0 15px 15px;width: 84px;height: 86px;">Additionally, you will not only learn to develop essential workplace skills, create impactful content, and design for usability, but you are also permitted&mdash;if you choose&mdash;to use AI in all stages of the writing process, including the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Brainstorming,</li>
            <li>Freewriting,</li>
            <li>Research,</li>
            <li>Outline creation,</li>
            <li>Draft review, and</li>
            <li>Review of deliverables, among other tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that you are not required to use AI. My full AI policy is included in the Short Guide to the course.


            If you choose to do so, you will need to follow the procedure outlined on the <a title="Using AI Ethically in This Course" href="/courses/216149/pages/using-ai-ethically-in-this-course" data-course-type="wikiPages" data-published="false" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/220090/pages/using-ai-ethically-in-this-course" data-api-returntype="Page"><strong>Using AI Ethically in This Course page</strong></a>. <em><strong>There are two assignments you must submit if you plan to use AI. They are noted on this page.</strong></em></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
        <p>Having successfully completed this course, students will be able to perform the technical writing tasks defined by the learning objectives for the course:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Analyze the rhetorical situation and determine the appropriate audience or users of written communication, considering the needs of global audiences and people with disabilities.</li>
            <li>Conduct research appropriate to workplace problem solving, such as literature review, evaluation of online resources, interview, and site inspection.</li>
            <li>Interpret research findings with understanding of ethical and human implications.</li>
            <li>Use conventions of various workplace genres, such as proposals, instructions, correspondence, reports, and slide decks, with understanding of how the genre conventions can be used as heuristics and as principles of arrangement.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with classmates in planning, researching, writing, revising, and presenting information.</li>
            <li>Apply principles of effective visual design for print and electronic presentation, including hierarchical, chronological, and spatial arrangements.</li>
            <li>Identify and apply the principles of effective style in the composing of usable, reader-centered written communications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Course Structure</h3>
        <p>This course consists of <strong>five modules</strong>, each containing an introductory page and broken down by week. <strong></strong><a title="Introduction to the Course" href="/courses/151641/pages/introduction-to-the-course" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/151641/pages/introduction-to-the-course" data-api-returntype="Page"><strong></strong></a>To access each module, click on "Modules" in the menu at left or go directly to the <a title="Modules" href="/courses/216149/modules" data-course-type="navigation" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/220090/modules" data-api-returntype="[Module]"><strong>Modules</strong></a> page.</p>

        <p>It is available as a Read-Only Google Doc.</p>

        <h3>Course Expectations</h3>
        <p>This course is 100% virtual; that is, we will never meet in the classroom. As a result, it is important that you understand how the course will be conducted and what will be expected of you as a student enrolled in it.</p>

        <p>As your teacher, it is my responsibility to (among other things)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Answer any questions you might have that are not covered by the textbook or another reading,</li>
            <li>Provide feedback to you about your work,</li>
            <li>Grade your work as promptly as possible,</li>
            <li>Use a grading rubric to help explain your grades,</li>
            <li>Update your grades on Canvas, and</li>
            <li>Inform you promptly of any alterations to the schedule, such as due date changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That said, in order to do well in this course, you must follow these policies:</p>

        <h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Read All Announcements</strong></h4>

                            <li>Announcements are the primary way I keep in touch with you, so it's imperative that you read every single one in its entirety. Not reading announcements will not be an excuse for not submitting work on time should a due date change.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

        <h4><strong>Assessment</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Every assignment in this course is worth 100 points.</li>
            <li>Unless otherwise noted on the assignment page, all major assignments, homework, discussion posts, and quizzes will be due by 11:59 on their designated days. (See individual assignments.)</li>
            <li>Plus and minus grades are used.</li>
            <li>Your assignments will be graded as soon as reasonably possible.</li>
            <li>If you have a questions/concerns/issues with a grade(s), please write or see me as soon as you can.</li>
            <li><strong>Final grades are rounded up. Individual assignment grades are not.</strong></li>
            <li>Please do not write at the end of the semester to tell me you need a grade of X in this course. I will not raise your grade beyond what is merited by your final average.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Submission Guidelines</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Unless otherwise noted, all major and homework assignments will be uploaded directly to the specific assignment page. That page will identify the type of file to be uploaded (.doc, .docx, .pdf).&nbsp;
                <ul>
                    <li>Read the assignment carefully, as sometimes the assignment requirements will note the form your submission should take.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Naming convention for all assignments: YourLastName_Assignment_Date or YourLastName-Assignment-Date. (EX: Smith_Proposal_Sp25 or Smith-Proposal-Sp25).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Due Dates &amp; Late Assignments</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extension Requests:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Major Assignments</strong>: <strong>You can request a 24-hour extension on ONE major assignment, but you must email me with the request 24 hours or more ahead of the due date</strong>. You'll get that extension -- <em><strong>no questions asked</strong></em>. Once you have used your one extension, any late work will be reduced one letter grade per day after the due date.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drafts &amp; Peer Evaluations: </strong>No extensions. This is the closest you will have to get to "group work" in this course, so your participation is required.</li>
                        <li><strong>Homework:</strong> No extensions for homework assignments. You get to drop your lowest homework grade, so if you miss one, it won't count against you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quizzes:</strong> No extensions for quizzes. You get to drop your lowest quiz grade as well.</li>
                        <li><strong>Discussions</strong>: No extensions for discussions because that totally defeats the point of having a discussion.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>We reject all forms of prejudice and discrimination, including those based on age, color, disability, gender, national origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, and veteran status. We take individual and collective responsibility for helping to eliminate bias and discrimination and for increasing our own understanding of these issues through education, training, and interaction with others.</li>
            <li>We pledge our collective commitment to these principles in the spirit of the Virginia Tech motto of <em>Ut Prosim</em> (That I May Serve).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Honor Code</strong></h4>
        <p>The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states:</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.</em></p>

        <p>Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code. For additional information about the Honor Code, please visit <a href="https://honorsystem.vt.edu/">The Office of Undergraduate Academic Integrity</a> (104 Hillcrest; 231-9876).</p>
