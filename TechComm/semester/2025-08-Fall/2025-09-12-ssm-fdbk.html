    <title>Feedback on the Subject Selection Message</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>I have added feedback on all of the Subject Selection Messages submitted by 11:59 PM Wednesday, September 10. In this post, I&rsquo;ll share details on what to do if you have an Incomplete on the project. I will also comment on your work generally, and suggest what you can do to improve your project if I asked you to revise. </p>
    <h2 style="color: #861f41;font-weight: bold;">If You Have an Incomplete</h2>
    <p>If you have an incomplete marked for your Subject Selection Message Assignment, you can still earn a Complete on the project.</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Read the feedback in annotations on your submission, in the rubric, and in the summary comment.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Revise your project to improve your work, adding whatever is missing or revising the information to include more (or accurate) details.</li>

    <h2 style="color: #861f41;font-weight: bold;">Specific Feedback</h2>
    <ul>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Include the message headings</strong> (to, from, subject). See the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/files/40320965?wrap=1">template</a>.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Pay attention to the requirements</strong> of the <em>Ut Prosim</em> project and the course assignments. Each project this term builds toward your ability to explain a complex topic clearly and accessibly to different real-world audiences, always with the goal of informing, guiding, or supporting action that contributes to fairness, accessibility, and the well-being of communities.<br>
            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Your projects explain something about your topic to non-experts. You&rsquo;re NOT building anything, developing software,
        </li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Focus! Narrow things down!</strong> This is a semester-long project. You won&rsquo;t have time to explain everything about your topic to everyone in the galaxy. Choose a specific aspect of your topic, and narrow your audience to a specific group.<br>
            <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
            <span style="margin-left: 24px">
                ❌ Nope: My audience is the local community.<br>
                ✔️ Yep! My audience is first-year students at Virginia Tech who are interested in using AI, but are concerned about academic integrity.
            </span>
        </li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Proofread. Use the grammar and spell checker in your word processor.</strong> No workplace wants to send out documents that are full of typos. Review your work to make sure you catch these errors.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Get help from the Writing Center (optional).</strong> Anyone can visit the Writing Center in the library for help with projects for the course. Writing Center tutors can help you strengthen your content as well as work on document design and other issues. You can read more about the Writing Center and make an appointment on the <a href="https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Writing Center&rsquo;s webpage</a>.</li>
