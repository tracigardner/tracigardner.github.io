            <h3><span style="font-size: 54px;float: left;">üëâ</span>Write to the Reader:<br> Use &ldquo;You&rdquo; for Actions</h3>
            <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">A simple way to make your proposal clearer is to use <strong>you-attitude</strong>&mdash;writing directly to your reader with &ldquo;you&rdquo; instead of abstract terms like &ldquo;the user&rdquo; or &ldquo;the applicant.&rdquo; Extend you-attitude to your pronouns as well. Use &ldquo;your community&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;the community.&rdquo;</p>



            This approach shifts the focus from the writer or the process to the person who must act, making steps in methods, timelines, and deliverables easier to follow.

            <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">You-attitude helps your audience see themselves in the document. It also cuts wordiness and turns vague requirements into specific actions. In short: it respects your reader&rsquo;s time and makes your proposal feel practical and usable.</p>
