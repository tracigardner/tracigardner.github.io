    <h1><em>Ut Prosim</em> Project Ideas Prompt</h1>


    <p>I am a student majoring in [add your major here] who is working on a semester-long technical writing project inspired by Virginia Tech’s motto, Ut Prosim (“That I May Serve”). My assignment is to research and write about a technical object, practice, or idea within my field that has the potential to create a positive social impact. The topic must be grounded in my major, clearly connected to community service, problem-solving, or the public good, and feasible to research and explain to multiple non-expert audiences. Please suggest 5–7 possible project topics that meet these criteria, with a brief explanation of how each could serve others or contribute to fairness, accessibility, or community well-being.</p>
