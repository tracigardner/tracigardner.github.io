                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Subject Selection Message has a Target Due Date of September 5. The semester-long <em>Ut Prosim</em> projects are due on various dates throughout the term. A list of Target Due Dates for assignments through September 26 is on <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/assignments/syllabus" target="_blank">the Syllabus page</a>.

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The deadlines for each week are available in the Module for that week. Additionally, a list of Target Due Dates for assignments through September 26 is on <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/assignments/syllabus" target="_blank">the Syllabus page</a>. Scroll down past the course policies manual. More dates will be listed as I add the course material.</p>

                <summary>All of the assignments are due on the same day every week, so I&rsquo;m struggling to find time.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Staggered deadlines&mdash;quizzes on Tuesday, discussions on Wednesday, projects on Thursday&mdash;rarely fit everyone&rsquo;s schedules. Instead, each week has one Target Due Date at the end of the week. The idea is to give you the freedom to manage your own time each week. Plan your own milestones, and complete all work by that Target Due Date. If you need more time any week, use the Grace Period.</p>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="dd-grace">
                <summary>I'm still a little confused about the grace period deadline.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Basically, the grace period is a automatic extension on all course assignments (except the final exam). You don&rsquo;t have to ask in advance or let me know you&rsquo;ve decided to use it.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Target Due Date for each week&rsquo;s work is Friday. The grace period gives you THREE extra class days to turn your work in. It ends on the Wednesday following the Target Due Date.</p>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="slp-major">
                <summary>I think I will have some difficulty deciding on a project that I will feel excited to write about.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Think about why you chose your major. What things were you interested in? What have your heard professors or classmates talk about that people do in your field? You have a fairly broad range to choose from. Try to come up with something you&rsquo;ve always wanted to know more about or something you&rsquo;ve always wanted more time to explore.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="slp-expectations">
                <summary>I am finding it slightly challenging to figure out exactly what is expected of us for the project.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The best explanation is on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/pages/semester-long-project-overview-writing-with-ut-prosim-in-mind" target="_blank">Semester-Long Project Overview: Writing with Ut Prosim in Mind page</a>. You&rsquo;re going to do research on your topic and write about it in several different genres. Your goal is to help others participate in the kind of work you talk about or understand why it matters.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="slp-passion">
                <summary>I am anxious about choosing my topic to research for the major project.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">I understand. It probably feels like the wrong choice can torpedo the entire semester. My advice is to think about this like a passion project, a self-directed, intrinsically motivated effort you choose to explore. If you choose something that matters to you, you can create something meaningful&mdash;and enjoy yourself at the same time.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="slp-inspiration">
                <summary>I know there are a lot of <em>Ut Prosim</em> projects in my major. I am just unsure what I will want to research.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Use those existing projects as a collection of ideas to get your thinking started. Heard about someone in your major working on a project that you wish you were involved in? Here&rsquo;s your chance to make it happen. Granted you won&rsquo;t be out there doing the fieldwork, but you&rsquo;ll have the chance to learn more about the topic and to share why it matters and how to get involved with others.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="slp-windmill">
                <summary>I am a little unsure about the semester-long project, especially in regards to the actual research or what the ultimate goal is.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The idea of the Ut Prosim project is that you, as an expert in your field, will explain ideas to non-experts and others. Your service in this context is to help people understand something.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Here&rsquo;s an example. If you wanted to focus on renewable energy generation for the Appalachian region, I don&rsquo;t expect you to go out and build a windmill. Instead, you need to be able to tell non-experts about building windmills, with the underlying notion that they might pursue the solution once they understand it.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In that example, I would expect you to do research on windmills&mdash;their impact on the environment, how they contribute to energy generation, and so forth. For this course, no actual windmills are necessary. If you want to build a LEGO windmill and share photos though, that would be fun.</p>
                </summary>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="">
                <summary>One thing I am still kind of unsure about is the longterm project we have and all the due dates we need to meet.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The due dates for the semester-long projects are spread out through the term, roughly every three or four weeks. A list of Target Due Dates for assignments through September 26 is on <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/assignments/syllabus" target="_blank">the Syllabus page</a>. Scroll down past the course policies manual. Other dates will be available as I publish the weekly modules.</p>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="wkld-reading">
                <summary>There&rsquo;s a lot of reading.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Yes, especially at the beginning of the course, there is a lot of reading. You need to familiarize yourself with a lot of basic concepts that you&rsquo;ll be using throughout the semester. Fortunately, there are some weeks later in the term when there are fewer readings. </p>
                </summary>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="wkld-semesterlong">
                <summary>Something that I&rsquo;m going to find challenging is the semester-long paper.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Actually, think of it as a semester-long project with several documents. You&rsquo;re not writing one giant document that you work on all term. You&rsquo;re writing six related major projects that are distributed during the semester. You can read a short description of the six documents on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/pages/semester-long-project-overview-writing-with-ut-prosim-in-mind" target="_blank">Semester-Long Project Overview: Writing with Ut Prosim in Mind page</a>.</p>

                <summary>I feel like there was quite a bit of work for this first week. Is it going to be like this every week?</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The amount of work will vary from week to week. You can look at the tasks for the first five weeks on the Modules page now. Most weeks you&rsquo;ll work on one of the major projects, have one to three quizzes and a check-in survey, and participate in a group discussion.</p>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="wkld-overwhelm">
                <summary>Maybe all of the assignments could be a bit overwhelming.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">True. Writing different kinds of technical documents can be overwhelming. They all have specific characteristics and expectations. I can give you two important tips.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">First, plan your work so that you have plenty of time. Waiting until the last minute when you&rsquo;re working on something unfamiliar is always challenging.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Second, use the assignments like a roadmap. They tell you exactly what you need to know and what you need to include. Follow them in the same way you&rsquo;d follow your turn-by-turn navigation instructions.</p>
                </summary>

            <h3 style="color: #861f41;font-size: 18px;"><strong>Writing Experience</strong></h3>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="we-awvtc">
                <summary>I&rsquo;m concerned about how in depth the concept of writing is. Such as technical writing versus academic writing.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The first chapter of the textbook talks about <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRIS8pYQLcWTlCcKB9Gwsnarc5AxOF7C_V7Ox8ft7OoN0kzIlB73PpeUXMpN4YwBMLLLG0ZPynPqmpF/pub#h.zheie7uji9eu">technical writing versus academic writing</a>.

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="we">
                <summary>I have very little experience with writing forms that are not opinionated essays or English essays.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">That&rsquo;s okay. Your writing experience is a good base for technical writing. While technical writing is different, it still relies on being able to think about your purpose and audience, just like any other kind of writing. As long as you keep the basics in mind, you should do just fine.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="we-hs">
                <summary>I&rsquo;ve only taken once writing class since the end of high school. OR I haven&rsquo;t written a paper since high school.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">That&rsquo;s the case for a lot of people in the course. You&rsquo;ve been focusing on science, math, and engineering. In this course, you&rsquo;re going to learn how to tell others about use all that content knowledge you have. As far as the writing goes, stick with the information in the textbook and the assignments. You should be fine, and if you&rsquo;re ever in doubt, you can always visit the <a href="https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html" target="_blank">Writing Center</a> for help.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="we-personal">
                <summary>How personal does the writing need to be?</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">I have two answers for you. In some ways, the writing is generally not personal at all. You will write about principles and concepts from your major as well as the work people in your major do. You won&rsquo;t write personal essays at all.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In other ways, the writing may matter to you personally. You are choosing a subject for your semester-long project that you are interested in or care about. While you care about the subject however, you&rsquo;re still not writing personal essays.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>


            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="">
                <summary>I hope to know the difference between technical writing and the writing I learned before. Does it relate to dissertation writing?</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">It can. The second project, the research proposal for your informational report, is similar to the research proposal you might write for a thesis or dissertation (though those will likely be longer documents). Other projects will focus on writing for the public, so they might cover the kind of topic or information you&rsquo;d discuss in a thesis or dissertation; however, they will be pitched to a very different audience.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="wkld-creative">
                <summary>I may perform poorly because I struggle to articulate myself in creative ways and in ways that others appreciate.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Creativity matters in all writing, but in technical writing, the creativity comes from making ideas from your career field easy for someone else to understand. You don&rsquo;t have to make up fantasy worlds or fictional stories. You&rsquo;ll start with very concrete information from your major.</p>
                </summary>
