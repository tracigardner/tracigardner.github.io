                <summary>It&rsquo;s hard for me to realize how to use AI and what are the limitations. Please give some examples of assignments for better understanding.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The first place to look for<a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2025-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall25.pdf#page=9"> information on AI is in the Short Guide</a> (pages 9&ndash;10), where I outline all the ways you can use Copilot or another tool.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Here are some example activities that incorporate AI:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 60px;">
                    <li><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/assignments/2468351" target="_blank">Subject Selection Message Self-Check</a>: Look for the link to prompts and instructions.</li>

                </ul>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="ai-notlistening">
                <summary>I found it a little challenging to have AI generate a response that didn&rsquo;t provide any suggestions even after explicitly telling it not to.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">AI rarely does <em>exactly</em> what we want it to do. Further, it takes some practice writing prompts to get to a point where you get consistent answers. You&rsquo;re not responsible for AI misbehaving. As long as you have the prompt that you used and the reply that AI gave you, you&rsquo;re covered.</p>

                <summary>The document samples and deliverable checklist are locked.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">I made a technical error in setting up the page of samples and the checklist page. As I posted last week, they&rsquo;re all available now. I apologize for the mistake. I know it was frustrating.</p>

                <summary>Some more past papers or prompts could be shown so I have a clear idea of what to write about.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have any examples that I can add at this point. The Technical &amp; Scientific Communication program redesigned the course during the summer, so these are all fresh, new assignments.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="model-length">
                <summary>Are the individual projects pieces that will make up a 15 page paper or are there multiple papers that will range from 1&ndash;15 pages?</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">There are six major projects, which generally range from 1 to 15 pages each. The Informational Report for Non-Expert Readers is the longest. Read a summary of all six projects on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/pages/semester-long-project-overview-writing-with-ut-prosim-in-mind" target="_blank">Semester-Long Project Overview: Writing with Ut Prosim in Mind page</a>.</p>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="model-disclength">
                <summary>The only thing I am a little unsure about is if there is a set length range you want the discussion responses to be.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">There is no set length&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t count words anyway (Who has time for that?) Your response to the discussions needs to be long enough to explain whatever it ask you to talk about or answer the relevant questions.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="model-specs">
                <summary>Is there a specification of length?</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Some of the assignments (but not all) include an estimate of the length. I don&rsquo;t count words or pages. I look for writing that makes sense and does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do.</p>

                <p>The only exception is the two-page fact sheet (the last major project). Fitting your information on two pages is part of that genre.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="model-discreply">
                <summary>I was slightly confused about how you wanted us to respond to some of the questions for the Reply aspect of Assignment 1.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">I&rsquo;m guessing you mean the reply to a classmate in the group discussion from Week 1. Can you give me more information? I need to know more about what is confusing you to help.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Also, nothing in the course is named Assignment 1, so I may have guessed wrong about your question. Let me know if that&rsquo;s the case.</p>

                <summary>Is this assignment due September 5th? Or do we have the whole semester?</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Subject Selection Message has a Target Due Date of September 5. The semester-long <em>Ut Prosim</em> projects are due on various dates throughout the term. A list of Target Due Dates for assignments through September 26 is on <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/assignments/syllabus" target="_blank">the Syllabus page</a>. Scroll down past the course policies manual. Other dates will be available as I publish the weekly modules. For now, I&rsquo;ve added dates to the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/pages/semester-long-project-overview-writing-with-ut-prosim-in-mind" target="_blank">Semester-Long Project Overview: Writing with Ut Prosim in Mind page</a>.</p>

                <summary>Is there an easily accessible list of deadlines for that assignment?</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The deadlines for each week are available in the Module for that week. Additionally, a list of Target Due Dates for assignments through September 26 is on <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/assignments/syllabus" target="_blank">the Syllabus page</a>.

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="dd-sameday">
                <summary>All of the assignments are due on the same day every week, so I&rsquo;m struggling to find time.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Staggered deadlines&mdash;quizzes on Tuesday, discussions on Wednesday, projects on Thursday&mdash;rarely fit everyone&rsquo;s schedules. Instead, each week has one Target Due Date at the end of the week. The idea is to give you the freedom to manage your own time each week. Plan your own milestones, and complete all work by that Target Due Date. If you need more time any week, use the Grace Period.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="dd-grace">
                <summary>I'm still a little confused about the grace period deadline.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Basically, the grace period is a automatic extension on all course assignments (except the final exam). You don&rsquo;t have to ask in advance or let me know you&rsquo;ve decided to use it.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Target Due Date for each week&rsquo;s work is usually Friday. The grace period gives you THREE extra class days to turn your work in. It ends on the Wednesday following the Target Due Date.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The only exception is the week of Fall break, when the Target Due Date is Thursday (since there are no classes on Friday). In that case, you get a bonus day, with the grace period still ending on the following Wednesday.</p>
                </summary>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="fdbk-speed">
                <summary>How quick assignments will normally be graded after submitting?</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">For major projects, allow a minimum of 3&ndash;4 days after the Target Due Date for me to add feedback. For longer projects, it may take a week.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">For homework that is not marked automatically by Canvas, it depends upon the activity. I do not mark Discussions until at least the Target Due Date passes and often I wait until the Grace Period closes since the posts require interaction. It&rsquo;s better to wait until everyone has turned in their work.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="fdbk-rubric">
                <summary>Will there be clear rubrics that detail what is expected for grading?</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">I provide rubrics for the Major Projects, but not the homework and other activities. Think of the homework that is not graded automatically like the kind of work your teacher marks with a checkmark. I look at your work, but I do not provide extensive comments unless something wows me or something is amiss. Either way, as long as you&rsquo;ve put in the effort, there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The groups have different purposes, but you&rsquo;ll never meet in person or collaborate on a group document. Here are the current and planned groups:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 48px;">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Elevens Groups:</strong> Set up to make the group discussions manageable. In my experience, a group of 88 people is not usable. I set up eight groups of eleven people to make the conversations easier.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>AI Groups:</strong> Two groups: one is everyone who has indicated they are using AI, and the other everyone who has not. Strictly to make it easier to message everyone in one of those groups without having to type every name.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Project Groups:</strong> A legacy group with no one in it. Some of the imported materials in the course used these groups in the past. I haven&rsquo;t deleted it because I&rsquo;m not sure if doing so will break something.</li>
                </ul>
                </summary>

                <summary>While I do like discussion posts, sometimes it is hard to type in the textbook</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Okay, you&rsquo;ve stumped me. I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean. The discussion posts shouldn&rsquo;t ask you to type in the textbook. Nothing should be asking you to type in the textbook. If this is your question, please, please send me a message and tell me more about what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>

                <summary>Something that I have found slightly challenging so far is clicking on the canvas links and instead of navigating me to a new tab it just changes the tab to what I clicked on. I would rather have it open a new tab so I can see all of the documents I need to complete each assignment.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">I hear you. That&rsquo;s my preference too; however, it is not considered accessible by the ADA Title II Digital Accessibility guidelines that all Virginia Tech sites have to meet by January 2026. The pages on the site that use the target="_blank" attribute do so because they use iframes, which require that setting to work properly for now.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Chapter 16 of the textbook talks about the use of AI. It was scheduled for Week One so that you could make informed decisions about using AI in the course if you were interested. We will not read the textbook from page 1 to page 400, in order. We&rsquo;ll dip in to the chapters we need for each task.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">I hope to have the information on the final posted in the next few weeks. It&rsquo;s an optional task you can complete if you need/want to.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Think about why you chose your major. What things were you interested in? What have your heard professors or classmates talk about that people do in your field? You have a fairly broad range to choose from. Try to come up with something you&rsquo;ve always wanted to know more about or something you&rsquo;ve always wanted more time to explore.</p>
                </summary>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The best explanation is on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/pages/semester-long-project-overview-writing-with-ut-prosim-in-mind" target="_blank">Semester-Long Project Overview: Writing with Ut Prosim in Mind page</a>. You&rsquo;re going to do research on your topic and write about it in several different genres. Your goal is to help others participate in the kind of work you talk about or understand why it matters.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="slp-passion">
                <summary>I am anxious about choosing my topic to research for the major project.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">I understand. It probably feels like the wrong choice can torpedo the entire semester. My advice is to think about this like a passion project, a self-directed, intrinsically motivated effort you choose to explore. If you choose something that matters to you, you can create something meaningful&mdash;and enjoy yourself at the same time.</p>
                </summary>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="slp-inspiration">
                <summary>I know there are a lot of <em>Ut Prosim</em> projects in my major. I am just unsure what I will want to research.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Use those existing projects as a collection of ideas to get your thinking started. Heard about someone in your major working on a project that you wish you were involved in? Here&rsquo;s your chance to make it happen. Granted you won&rsquo;t be out there doing the fieldwork, but you&rsquo;ll have the chance to learn more about the topic and to share why it matters and how to get involved with others.</p>
                </summary>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="slp-windmill">
                <summary>I am a little unsure about the semester-long project, especially in regards to the actual research or what the ultimate goal is.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The idea of the Ut Prosim project is that you, as an expert in your field, will explain ideas to non-experts and others. Your service in this context is to help people understand something.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Here&rsquo;s an example. If you wanted to focus on renewable energy generation for the Appalachian region, I don&rsquo;t expect you to go out and build a windmill. Instead, you need to be able to tell non-experts about building windmills, with the underlying notion that they might pursue the solution once they understand it.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In that example, I would expect you to do research on windmills&mdash;their impact on the environment, how they contribute to energy generation, and so forth. For this course, no actual windmills are necessary. If you want to build a LEGO windmill and share photos though, that would be fun.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="slp-windmill2">
                <summary> I&rsquo;m unsure if our semester-long project is meant to create an actual physical solution we are to implement based on the problem we select.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">See the previous question.</p>
                </summary>
            </details>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="slp-duedates">
                <summary>One thing I am still kind of unsure about is the longterm project we have and all the due dates we need to meet.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The due dates for the semester-long projects are spread out through the term, roughly every three or four weeks. A list of Target Due Dates for assignments through September 26 is on <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/assignments/syllabus" target="_blank">the Syllabus page</a>.

                <summary>If I later on want to change my subject after approval am I able to change it or is my decision final?</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Your decision should be final. You are not making a trial choice. Choose something that will work and that you can stick with.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">That said, if something goes horribly wrong, send me a message that tells me what&rsquo;s going on and we can talk about your situation.</p>

                <summary>I&rsquo;m unclear of what the guidelines of the topic selection are besides that it has to relate to your major.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In addition to relating to your major, you are looking for a topic (a technical object, practice, or idea within your field) that you, as an expert in your field, can explain to non-experts and others.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Your topic should have the potential to create a positive social impact. In the spirit of <em>Ut Prosim</em>, your topic should be:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 60px;">
                    <li>Grounded in your major or area of study.</li>
                    <li>Clearly connected to community service, problem-solving, or public good.</li>
                    <li>Feasible to research and explain to multiple non-expert audiences.</li>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Naturally, your topic needs to be relevant and feasible for you to research. You don&rsquo;t have to come up with some brand-new thing.

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">That&rsquo;s fine. The topic doesn&rsquo;t have to be well-known by non-experts to work for the project. Your Audience Analysis section explains what non-experts are likely to know and what they need to know to understand the topic.

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The assignment is to create a message that explains the basics about the topic you&rsquo;ve chosen. Use the details under the &ldquo;Assignment Requirements&rdquo; heading on the assignment page to include the right information.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">You are writing only the subject selection message now. The other assignments are distributed during the semester.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The message includes four to six paragraphs, outlined under the &ldquo;Assignment Requirements&rdquo; heading on the assignment page. The paragraphs are all in one message (one file).</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">True. Writing different kinds of technical documents can be overwhelming. They all have specific characteristics and expectations. I can give you two important tips.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">First, plan your work so that you have plenty of time. Waiting until the last minute when you&rsquo;re working on something unfamiliar is always challenging.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Second, use the assignments like a roadmap. They tell you exactly what you need to know and what you need to include. Follow them in the same way you&rsquo;d follow your turn-by-turn navigation instructions.</p>

The links are on the module page, and they&rsquo;re also on the Module Introduction page. Second, use the To Do list in the right sidebar in Canvas to see a list of tasks that are due and upcoming.

Choose a time slot that works for you (like 11 AM MWF), put it in your calendar so that you get reminders, and do work during that time period. Don't leave it for &quot;when you have time.&quot; That typically causes the most trouble if you forget or get busy.</p>

Reading that section should help you.</p>

                <summary>I have very little experience with writing forms that are not opinionated essays or English essays.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">That&rsquo;s okay. Your writing experience is a good base for technical writing. While technical writing is different, it still relies on being able to think about your purpose and audience, just like any other kind of writing. As long as you keep the basics in mind, you should do just fine.</p>

                <summary>I&rsquo;ve only taken once writing class since the end of high school. OR I haven&rsquo;t written a paper since high school.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">That&rsquo;s the case for a lot of people in the course. You&rsquo;ve been focusing on science, math, and engineering. In this course, you&rsquo;re going to learn how to tell others about use all that content knowledge you have. As far as the writing goes, stick with the information in the textbook and the assignments. You should be fine, and if you&rsquo;re ever in doubt, you can always visit the <a href="https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html" target="_blank">Writing Center</a> for help.</p>

                <summary>How personal does the writing need to be?</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">I have two answers for you. In some ways, the writing is generally not personal at all. You will write about principles and concepts from your major as well as the work people in your major do. You won&rsquo;t write personal essays at all.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In other ways, the writing may matter to you personally. You are choosing a subject for your semester-long project that you are interested in or care about. While you care about the subject however, you&rsquo;re still not writing personal essays.</p>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="we-diss">
                <summary>I hope to know the difference between technical writing and the writing I learned before. Does it relate to dissertation writing?</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">It can. The second project, the research proposal for your informational report, is similar to the research proposal you might write for a thesis or dissertation (though those will likely be longer documents). Other projects will focus on writing for the public, so they might cover the kind of topic or information you&rsquo;d discuss in a thesis or dissertation; however, they will be pitched to a very different audience.</p>

            <details style="margin-bottom: 15px;" id="wkld-creative">
                <summary>I may perform poorly because I struggle to articulate myself in creative ways and in ways that others appreciate.</summary>
                <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Creativity matters in all writing, but in technical writing, the creativity comes from making ideas from your career field easy for someone else to understand. You don&rsquo;t have to make up fantasy worlds or fictional stories. You&rsquo;ll start with very concrete information from your major.</p>
