        <p>Although the primary purpose of this course is to teach you about technical or workplace writing, it also contains information about how you can use AI ethically to improve your critical thinking, analysis, and writing skills. I want you to be able to use AI but to do so ethically; thus, I have created this page as a one-stop guide for your ethical use. If you have a question that is not answered by the categories on this page, please let me know as soon as possible.</p>

        <p><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/noun_important_2261771.png" alt="Important" style="float: left; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;width: 64px;height: 64px;"><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>You are encouraged to use Bing Copilot, as it safeguards your information. However, if you prefer another AI, such as ChatGPT or Claude.ai, you can use it.</em></p>

        <h2 style="clear:both;">Assignments Required if You Plan to Use AI</h2>
        <p>In order to use AI in this course, you must submit the following two assignments by their due dates and <em>before</em> you use AI.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/assignments/2468318" target="_blank"><strong>AI Use Pledge for Technical Writing</strong></a></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/216149/quizzes/618869" target="_blank"><strong>Quiz on textbook Chapter 16: Use of Artificial Intelligence in Technical Writing</strong></a></p>
        <p>Because you have the option of using AI (or not using it), <em>these two assignments will not count toward your final grade</em>; however, you must submit them in order to use AI.</p>

        <h2>How You Can Use AI</h2>
        <p>Each assignment will indicate whether you use AI to complete it. However, just to make sure there&rsquo;s a simple list you can refer to quickly, you are allowed to use AI for the following tasks:</p>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li><strong>Brainstorming</strong>: Brainstorming is the rapid-fire generation of ideas, for instance, for the subject of an assignment. When you are asked to choose your own topic for an assignment, you can generate a list of all topics that interest you, create a prompt that includes the assignment parameters, and ask AI to help you evaluate your list for the most promising idea(s).</li>
            <li><strong>Freewriting Review</strong>: Freewriting involves writing as quickly as you can in phrases and sentences about your subject, without stopping to critique or edit what you are writing. This exercise frees your thoughts. If you choose or are asked to freewrite for an assignment, you can then write a prompt including the assignment parameters, submit what you have written to AI, and ask for assistance in selecting parts of the freewriting that could work in your project.</li>
            <li><strong>Outline Creation</strong>: After you have created your own outline, you can ask AI to create an outline for the same topic. You&rsquo;ll then compare the two, determine the best elements of each, and merge them into a single new outline. You can also use AI for reverse outlining by asking AI to create an outline for your uploaded draft. You&rsquo;ll then compare AI&rsquo;s outline to what the assignment calls for.</li>
            <li><strong>Research</strong>: You are free to use AI for researching a topic, but you need to know that popular AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude.ai cannot currently provide you with reliable sources. For your research, you are encouraged to use Bing Copilot, Perplexity, Research Rabbit, and Scite. Regardless of the AI tool you choose, always confirm the sources AI suggests.</li>
            <li><strong>Draft Review</strong>: When used in ethical ways, AI is perfectly acceptable for draft reviewing. In this course, you must create a prompt that asks AI to evaluate your draft in specific ways, such as for tone, confusing passages or lack of plain language, effective paragraphing, wordiness, basic grammatical mistakes, ineffective document design (or a combination of these things). You can also ask AI to point out sections that need more support (i.e., evidence and proof). You cannot ask AI to revise your draft, so you must include that in your prompt: <em><strong>Please do not revise the draft; merely point out areas for improvement</strong></em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Self-Checks</strong>: You can use AI for all of the Self-Checks for the major projects in the course. These assignments provide you with a prompt that compares your draft to the requirements for the assignment. It does not change the draft. Instead, it provides a list of suggestions to ensure you meet the requirements for the project.</li>

            <li>Any other ways indicated in announcements, assignments, and the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2025-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall25.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">AI Policy in the Short Guide</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How You Cannot Use AI &amp; Why</h2>
        <p>On the flip side, you cannot use AI to</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generate a draft or final product,</li>
            <li>Rewrite your draft or final product,</li>
            <li>Rewrite sentences or passages in your draft or final product.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Doing any of the above directly violates the Plagiarism and Falsification sections of the <strong><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.registrar.vt.edu/content/dam/registrar_vt_edu/documents/governance/2015-2016/HONOR-CODE-MANUAL-10-9-15.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia Tech Honor Code</a></strong>:</p>
        <ol start="2" style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><strong>Plagiarism</strong>: Includes the copying of the language, structure, programming, computer code, ideas, and/or thoughts of another and passing off the same as one&rsquo;s own original work or attempts thereof.</li>
            <li><strong>Falsification</strong>: Includes the statement of any untruth, either verbally or in writing, with respect to any circumstances relevant to one&rsquo;s academic work or attempts thereof.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Required Citation of AI Use</h2>
        <p>Any assistance you receive from AI -- even if it's required for an assignment -- should be cited, just like any other source. Get in the habit of indicating when AI has been consulted.</p>
        <p>For this class, do this with every assignment for which you used AI:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Insert a footnote in ONE of two places:
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>The document title (within the document itself) or</li>
                    <li>At the end of your name in the From line (if a memo).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Include in your actual footnote the ways you consulted AI for the assignment.
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>You can write something as simple as &ldquo;<em>For this assignment, I used AI in the brainstorming process, to create a stronger outline, to review my draft and final version, and for the self-check.</em>&rdquo;</li>
                    <li>Be comprehensive!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/noun_important_2261771.png" alt="Important" style="float: left; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;width: 64px;height: 64px;">It is important for you to get into the habit of citing AI. <em><strong>If you use AI and don&rsquo;t include a citation, your grade will be an Incomplete.</strong></em> If the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2025-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall25.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Revision Deadline</a> has not closed, you can revise however.</p>
        <h2 style="clear:both;">AI Use Procedures: Step-by-Step</span></strong></h2>
        <p>For any writing assignment in this course for which you use AI:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Create a file in a Word or Google Doc, and give it a name that indicates it is a draft for the assignment. <em>This document will become your <strong>Working Doc</strong>.</em></li>
            <li>Add the heading <strong>First Draft</strong>, and write your draft under the heading. </li>
            <li>Upload your Working Doc draft to AI using a prompt that (a) briefly summarizes the assignment and (b) asks AI to suggest areas in your draft that need improvement and why. <em>Tell AI NOT to revise your draft directly.</em></li>
            <li>Add the heading <strong>AI Response</strong> after your first draft.</li>
            <li>Copy and paste the AI response below the heading AI Response.</li>
            <li>Copy your first draft and paste it below the AI response, under the heading <strong>Second Draft</strong>.</li>
            <li>Add the heading <strong>Revised Draft</strong>, and copy your first draft and paste it under this heading.</li>
            <li>Revise this copied version of your draft according to the advice given to you by AI.</li>
            <li>Copy and paste the final version of your draft into a new Word or Google Doc for submission to the assignment.</li>
            <li>Give this document the title <strong>Yourlastname-Shortversionofassignmentname</strong> or <strong>Yourlastname_Shortversionofassignmentname</strong></li>
            <li>Upload BOTH the final version and the Working Doc to the assignment.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to Prompt AI Effectively</h2>
        <p>The secret to getting AI to do your bidding lies in the quality of your prompt, the actual question or command you provide for it. To develop a well-built prompt, University of Pennsylvania Wharton School professor Ethan provides the following 7 suggestions in his article &ldquo;<strong><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/now-is-the-time-for-grimoires" target="_blank">Now is the Time for Grimoires</a>.&rdquo;</strong></p>

                        <p>Assign the chatbot an actual role and a task. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
                        <p><em>You are a student in X course who is tasked with writing a recommendation report on the use of AI in education settings.</em></p>

                        <p>Be specific in setting forth the goal of the prompt, based on what you want AI to do for you:</p>
                        <p><em>Create an outline for a recommendation report on the use of AI in education. <br /></em></p>

                        <p>Expand on the goal you set forth in the previous step:</p>
                        <p><em>This outline should provide a brief overview of AI, review the current state of AI in education, discuss the pros and cons of integrating AI, and make recommendations about how a teacher can integrate AI successfully into her course to enhance student learning. </em></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the instructions provided by Mollick sound complicated, you might consider the advice covered by ZDNet senior contributed editor David Gewirtz, who in his online article about &ldquo;<strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/8-ways-to-write-better-chatgpt-prompts-and-get-the-results-you-want-faster/" target="_blank">8 Ways to Write Better ChatGPT Prompts</a></strong>&rdquo; makes three key suggestions that will prepare you for writing stronger prompts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Talk to the AI like you would talk to a person.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask multi-step questions. Ask a question, get a response. Based on that response, ask another question. . . . And it fits with the &lsquo;talking to a friend&rsquo; analogy. You wouldn&rsquo;t just ask one question to a friend and then walk away. You&rsquo;d have a conversation. Do the same with the AI.&rdquo;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Set the stage and provide context.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>&ldquo;Writing a ChatGPT prompt is more than just asking a one-sentence question. It often involves providing relevant background information to set the context of the query.&rdquo;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tell the AI to assume an identity or a profession.</strong><br />
                <ul>
                    <li>&ldquo;One of ChatGPT&rsquo;s coolest features is that it can write from the point of view of a specific person or profession. . . . [D]ifferent identities allow the AI to provide different perspectives as part of its response.&rdquo;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <Sample Prompts</strong></span>
        </h3>
        <p>Here are some sample prompts to get you started.</p>
        <h4><strong>Prompt 1: Draft Review</strong></h4>
        <p>I&rsquo;m working on an assignment that asks me to explain a complex technical concept to a non-expert audience. Please read my draft and identify unclear or confusing sections, overly complex language, or weak paragraph transitions. Please do not revise my draft&mdash;only point out areas that could be improved and why.</p>
        <h4><strong>Prompt 2: Freewriting Review</strong></h4>
        <p>Here is a freewriting exercise I did to explore a topic for an assignment. The assignment requires me to write a technical fact sheet for non-experts. Can you help identify the most promising ideas or directions from my freewriting? Please explain your reasoning.</p>
        <h4><strong>Prompt 3: Outline Comparison</strong></h4>
        <p>I have created this outline for an informational report. Based on the assignment goal&mdash;explaining a socially beneficial technical practice to non-experts&mdash;can you generate your own outline? Then help me compare mine with yours and suggest improvements I might make.</p>
        <h4><strong>Prompt 4: Research Planning</strong></h4>
        <p>I&rsquo;m preparing to research a topic related to ethical AI use in education. Can you help me brainstorm potential questions to guide my research, and suggest specific areas where academic or government sources might be especially useful?</p>
