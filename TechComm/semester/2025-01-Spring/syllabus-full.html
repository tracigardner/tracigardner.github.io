        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>English 3764: Technical Writing will enable you to gain an understanding of the theories, issues, and practices of technical communications you might encounter as in the workplace, such as general correspondence, proposals, reports, and presentations.</p>
        <p>From a foundation based on the principles of rhetoric, you will learn to analyze writing situations, consider the needs of your audience, assemble researched and original evidence, and design final documents that are user friendly and visually persuasive. By the time this course is over, you should be able not only to understand these documents, but also to produce them with ease and with confidence.</p>
        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
        <p>Having successfully completed this course, students will be able to perform the technical writing tasks defined by the learning objectives for the course:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze the rhetorical situation and determine the appropriate audience or users of written communication, considering the needs of global audiences and people with disabilities.</li>
            <li>Conduct research appropriate to workplace problem solving, such as literature review, evaluation of online resources, interview, and site inspection.</li>
            <li>Interpret research findings with understanding of ethical and human implications.</li>
            <li>Use conventions of various workplace genres, such as proposals, instructions, correspondence, reports, and slide decks, with understanding of how the genre conventions can be used as heuristics and as principles of arrangement.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with classmates in planning, researching, writing, revising, and presenting information.</li>
            <li>Apply principles of effective visual design for print and electronic presentation, including hierarchical, chronological, and spatial arrangements.</li>
            <li>Identify and apply the principles of effective style in the composing of usable, reader-centered written communications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Course Expectations</h3>
        <p>This course is 100% virtual; that is, we will never meet in the classroom. As a result, it is important that you understand how the course will be conducted and what will be expected of you as a student enrolled in it.</p>
        <p>As your teacher, it is my responsibility to (among other things)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Answer any questions you might have that are not covered by the textbook or another reading,</li>
            <li>Provide feedback to you about your work,</li>
            <li>Grade your work as promptly as possible,</li>
            <li>Use a grading rubric to help explain your grades,</li>
            <li>Update your grades on Canvas, and</li>
            <li>Inform you promptly of any alterations to the schedule, such as due date changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That said, in order to do well in this course, you must follow these policies:</p>
        <h4>Read All Announcements</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Announcements are the primary way I keep in touch with you, so it&rsquo;s imperative that you read every single one in its entirety. Not reading announcements will not be an excuse for not submitting work on time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Be Aware of Due Dates/Times</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Most (if not all) assignments are set to be due by 11:59 pm. You can, of course, upload your work earlier. All work should be uploaded in the appropriate manner to the appropriate page on the Canvas site.
            <li>See the information on <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2025-01-Spring/ShortGuide2TW-Spring25.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Target Due Dates and Checkpoint Deadlines</a> for additional details on these dates. The full list of course due dates and deadlines is listed in the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/short-guide/dates.html" target="_blank">Technical Writing Dates and Deadlines</a>.</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Read All Materials and Review Examples</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Specific chapters were chosen from three different Open Educational Resource textbooks to give you the best possible introduction to the material. Our Canvas site also includes course-specific resource modules. Please ensure that you read all of this material before working on assignments.</li>
            <li>You will also find sample documents to most major assignment pages and some homework assignments. Review them. Pay attention to them. Many of them are real &ldquo;A&rdquo; level documents produced in this course.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Apply What You are Learning</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Do your best to apply what you have read and the lessons you have learned from reviewing examples to producing and improving your own work.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Follow Assignment Instructions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Each assignment provides you with a description of the deliverable and the specifications, including page length, formatting, and other requirements. Assignments other than discussions include checklists that are designed to help you cover all requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Conduct Yourself Professionally</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For this course, just as for one that meets in a classroom, you are expected to be civil to other participants and to the instructor, to apply what you are learning about professional correspondence to any messages or discussion posts, and to contribute conscientiously to any discussions and group assignments.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Course Policies</h3>
        <h4>Absences</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Granted, it is difficult to take roll in an online course that has no set meeting times. However, it is somewhat common to get overwhelmed, particularly if you are taking more than one online course. Sometimes, students even disappear (so to speak) from online classes. And that&rsquo;s truly what being absent means in a class that meets virtually: to go missing.</li>
            <li>Don&rsquo;t disappear and expect to make up missed work (daily work or major assignments). If you do disappear, expect that you will have to go to your dean (in person or via email) to provide me with an excuse before I will accept any missed work. If you cannot provide me with a legit excuse via your dean, the missed work will be entered as a zero (or zeroes).</li>
            <li>In the end, you will get the grade you get. If you decide to skip three major assignments and all homework, that&rsquo;s okay with me, as long as you realize you will not be permitted to make it up without documentation.</li>
            <li>If circumstances prevent participation or timely completion of assignments, you must contact me in advance of due dates.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Incompletes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>My department&rsquo;s policy states, &ldquo;Incompletes are for students who did their work during the semester but could not complete course requirements because of a problem or emergency at the end of the term.&rdquo; As a result, I cannot offer Incompletes for anyone who failed to keep up during the term. If you find you have an impossible amount of work to complete by the end of the term, withdrawing from the course is likely the best solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Participation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Participants in this course should expect to spend about 8&ndash;10 hours per week involved in the activities and completion of assignments over the semester. This is similar to the time one would invest in a course in a traditional classroom setting.</li>
            <li>This time invested is an average, with some weeks requiring more and some less time to complete all assignments and activities. Participation will be evaluated as the completion of all activities within the unit or module period.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Grading Policies</h3>

        <h4>Effort Expectations Contract</h4>
        <p>There is only one letter grade in this course: the course grade I enter for you at the end of the term. Your course grade is determined by comparing the amount of work you have earned a Complete on to the expectations shown in the table below, which serves as a contract for course grades.</p>

        <h4>Additional Assessment Guidelines</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no math calculation involved. I do not average the percentages or make any other calculation with the numbers to determine your grade.</li>
            <li>I start with your course grade for the Major Projects and then move your grade up or down based on how you did in the other categories.</li>
            <li>The different categories listed on the Effort Expectations Contract are not equivalent. The Major Projects category is the most important category and holds the strongest weight on your grade.</li>
            <li>To earn a Complete for the group projects, you must participate fully in the projects as well as submit documents that meet the basic criteria.</li>
            <li>To earn an A or an A-, you must earn a Complete on all of the Major Projects.</li>
            <li>You cannot pass the course without earning a Complete on at least Two Major Projects. If you have an F for the Major Projects category, you have an F as your course grade.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>See &ldquo;<a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2025-01-Spring/ShortGuide2TW-Spring25.pdf#page=15;">How Assessment Works</a>&rdquo; in the Short Guide for more information on assessment in the course.</p>

        <h4>Submission Guidelines</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Unless otherwise noted, all work for the course is completed in Canvas. You will submit your work on the specific assignment page. That page will identify what you need to write or the type of file to be uploaded (.doc, .docx, .pdf).</li>
            <li>Suggested naming convention for all assignments: YourLastName_Assignment_Date or YourLastName-Assignment-Date. (EX: Smith_UserManual_S25).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Late Assignments</h4>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <p>
                I accept late work for most of the assignments in this course, using a Grace Period system. You don&rsquo;t need to ask in advance or explain why your work is late. Just take more time when you need it, as many times as you need it. Turn your work in when you can before the grace period ends.
            </p>
            <p>For additional details, see the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2025-01-Spring/ShortGuide2TW-Spring25.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Short Guide</a>.</p>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Details on the Grace Period</h5>
            <p>The grace period covers most situations, whether a religious holiday, academic conflict, illness, or a personal issue. If you cannot meet a due date, use the grace period. The grace period occurs between the target due date and the last moment that you can submit work in the course.</p>
            <p>Canvas indicates the end of the grace period as the “available until” date. If you turn in your work during the Grace Period, Canvas will mark the activity as Late. Don&lsquo;t worry about this late label. There is no grade penalty for work submitted during the grace period.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Grading Scale</h4>
        <p>I assign letter grades at the end of the term, not numbers. If a number is ever needed however, this course uses the university&rsquo;s default grading scale:</p>
        <table class="alternateTable syllabusTable" style="width: 400px;border-collapse: collapse;" border="2">

        <ul>
            <li>We affirm the inherent dignity and value of every person and strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual respect and understanding.</li>
            <li>We affirm the right of each person to express thoughts and opinions freely.</li>

            <li>We reject all forms of prejudice and discrimination, including those based on age, color, disability, gender, national origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, and veteran status. We take individual and collective responsibility for helping to eliminate bias and discrimination and for increasing our own understanding of these issues through education, training, and interaction with others.</li>

        <p>Students are strongly discouraged from misusing sites such as Chegg and CourseHero, as well as misusing ChatGPT and other Generative Artificial Intelligence. Students are strongly encouraged to consult their faculty members regarding the use of such outside materials as the misuse of these sources may constitute a violation of the Honor Code. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code.</p>
        <p>Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code.

        <p><em>Accommodations</em></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <p>Everyone needs special accommodations at some point because we all learn differently. I am happy to work directly with you or with the <a href="http://www.ssd.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) staff</a> to make sure that you have the support you need.</p>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 0px;">How do I document what will help me?</h5>
            <p>To document what will help you the most, please contact <a href="http://ssd.vt.edu/students.html" target="_blank">Services for Students with Disabilities</a> (SSD) in 310 Lavery Hall (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rNDopPaCXok" target="_blank">map link</a>, above the Turner Place Dining Center) as soon as possible to ensure that you have the resources you need to participate in the class. The procedures and forms you need are also available on the SSD website.</p>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 0px;">When do I let you know what I need?</h5>
            <p>Please let me know what you need during the first week of the term so that I can be sure you have the resources you need as soon as possible.&nbsp;Also email me your documentation from the SSD office by the end of the first week of class if possible. If not possible, send the information as soon as you can. Because I am not on campus due to COVID-19, do not take your documentation to my office.</p>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 0px;">What if I do not have official documentation?</h5>
            <p>That&rsquo;s okay too. I know that the official testing can be expensive and time-consuming. Send me <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10573-4212710324" target="_blank">a private message in Canvas</a> that tells me what you need, and I will try to help.</p>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 0px;">I need extra time on projects.</h5>
            <p>No problem. If you need more time on a project or need to complete work in a less distracting environment, take the time you need. Check <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-MeXdKL8mGtBq6HXArIoH_iWfVrOyyR4m-JMLsYVOFw/edit#heading=h.sh3i164rz29" target="_blank">the late policy</a> in the Course Policy Manual for more details.</p>
