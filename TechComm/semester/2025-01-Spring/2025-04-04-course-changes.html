    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">In response to your feedback, I am making some changes to the course that I hope will help with the two main challenges you mentioned in last week&rsquo;s Check-In Survey: (1) Group Challenges, and (2) Assignment Confusion.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#861f41;border-bottom: 1px solid #e5751f;">Some Course Details</h2>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The Project Management unit requires group work. Collaborative project management is a program requirement. You cannot complete these projects individually. </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The longer, detailed assignments will continue to be available because some students prefer the full details on the course work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color:#861f41;border-bottom: 1px solid #e5751f;">Assignment Changes</h2>


    <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/assignments/2273851" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Assignment</a> is being replaced by the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/assignments/2380220" target="_blank">Fact Sheet Collection Assignment</a>. This new assignment should relieve group challenges by shifting to more individual responsibility.<br />
            <br />
            Here are the important details:

            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;font-weight: bold;">The Fact Sheet Collection is still a group assignment; however, I will grade it individually.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Required Group Work:</strong> Each group must meet to make some basic decisions to coordinate the collection, including writing the front matter.
                    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Group members who do not contribute to group decision-making and group meetings earn an Incomplete on weekly activities.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Group leaders may make binding decisions with the group members who do participate (with one exception, see iv).</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Binding decisions means that group members who choose not to participate are bound by the decisions that those who do contribute make.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The Exception: Group members are free to choose their own fact sheet topics, as long as they do not choose a topic that has already been claimed (first come, first served).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Required Individual Work:</strong> Each group member will write a fact sheet that is added to the collection.
                    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">⚠️ Group members who do not submit a draft of a fact sheet by the Target Due Date will earn an Incomplete. This requirement is intended to keep any group member from preventing the group from waiting to submit their work.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Other assignments in the course will necessarily change.</strong> I will update assignments and other resources as quickly as I can. These changes mean the following for you:
            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">You will still use the research your groups gather this week.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">⚠️ Do <strong>NOT</strong> work ahead. Give me a chance to update the relevant assignments.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">If you have not turned in your Group Proposal, continue that work. Here&rsquo;s why:
                    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The website your group chooses will be the website your Fact Sheet Collection focuses on.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">If you choose not to participate in the proposal, you will still be required to use the website your group chooses.</li>
                    </ol>


                </li>
            </ol>
