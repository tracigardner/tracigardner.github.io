    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Based on your Check-In Survey feedback, I’m updating the course to address your two biggest concerns: (1) group issues and (2) assignment confusion.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#861f41;border-bottom: 1px solid #e5751f;">Course Reminders</h2>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Group work in the Project Management unit is required. It’s part of the program—these projects cannot be completed individually.</li>
        <li>Assignments emphasize usability, accessibility, and design—essential skills in technical writing. Mastering skills like plain language and the CRAP principles will improve your writing across any career.</li>
        <li>I&rsquo;m adding shorter, infographic versions of the assignments. Full assignment details will remain available for those who prefer in-depth guidance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color:#861f41;border-bottom: 1px solid #e5751f;">Assignment Changes</h2>

    <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
        <li>
            The <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/assignments/2273851" target="_blank">Recommendation Report</a> has been replaced by the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/assignments/2380220" target="_blank">Fact Sheet Collection</a>. This new assignment should relieve group challenges by shifting to more individual responsibility.

            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
                <li><strong>Group Requirements:</strong> Groups must coordinate the design of the collection and write the front matter.
                    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
                        <li>Non-participating members will receive an <strong>Incomplete</strong> for weekly work.</li>
                        <li>Group leaders may make binding decisions with participating members (except for fact sheet topics).</li>
                        <li>Fact sheet topics are chosen individually—first come, first served.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Individual Requirements:</strong> Each student writes a fact sheet for the collection.
                    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
                        <li>⚠️ If you do not submit a draft of a fact sheet by the Target Due Date, you will earn an Incomplete. This criteria ensures no one holds up the group.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Other assignments will change accordingly.</strong> I’ll update them as soon as possible.
            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
                <li>You’ll still use your group’s research from this week.</li>
                <li>⚠️ Do <strong>NOT</strong> work ahead until updates are posted.</li>
                <li>If you haven’t submitted your Group Proposal, continue working on it:
                    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
                        <li>Your group’s chosen website will be the focus of your collection.</li>
                        <li>If you don’t contribute to the proposal, you must still use the selected website.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
