<h3>⚖️ Creating a Conflict Resolution Plan for Your Group</h3>

<p>Group projects come with challenges, and disagreements are bound to happen. The key to success isn’t avoiding conflict—it’s handling it effectively. This week, take time with your group to create a <span class="highlight">Conflict Resolution Plan</span> using the steps below.</p>

<h4>🛑 Step 1: Identify and Assess Issues</h4>
<p>Not all conflicts are the same, so your group should decide how to recognize when a disagreement needs discussion. Establish a method for expressing concerns respectfully, documenting issues (e.g., Canvas discussion or a shared doc), and determining whether a conflict is minor or significant enough to require more attention.</p>

<h4>💡 Step 2: Propose and Choose Solutions</h4>
<p>Once an issue is identified, work as a team to generate solutions. Will your group rely on discussion, voting, or another decision-making method? Establish a process now so that resolving conflicts is smooth and efficient later.</p>

<h4>🚀 Step 3: Take Action and Follow Up</h4>
<p>Choosing a solution is only part of the process—your group must also implement it. Assign responsibilities to ensure everyone follows through, and set a time to check in and confirm the issue has been fully resolved.</p>

<h4>📞 Step 4: Seek Instructor Guidance if Needed</h4>
<p>If a conflict escalates or isn’t improving, decide when it’s appropriate to reach out for instructor support. Agree on who will send the message and what details should be included to explain the situation clearly.</p>

<h4>🤝 Step 5: Maintain a Positive Team Environment</h4>
<p>Preventing conflict is just as important as resolving it. Set expectations for respectful communication, supporting team members who may be struggling, and keeping motivation high to ensure a smooth collaboration.</p>

<h3>📞 When to Ask for Instructor Help with Group Issues</h3>
<p>Sometimes, conflicts can&rsquo;t be resolved within the group. If communication breaks down or a teammate isn&rsquo;t contributing at all, it may be time to reach out for help. Agree on who in the group will contact the instructor and include clear details: What&rsquo;s the issue? What has the group done to fix it? What support is needed?</p>

<h3>🤝 Keeping Your Group Positive & Productive</h3>
<p>Conflicts happen, but a supportive group environment can prevent many issues before they start. Keep communication respectful, check in on teammates who may be struggling, and celebrate small wins along the way. A positive, motivated team works better together!</p>
