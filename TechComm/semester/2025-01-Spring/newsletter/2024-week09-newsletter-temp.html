	<h1>📬 Writing Insights Newsletter – Week 8</h1>

	<p>We’re entering the second half of the semester — well done! This week’s check-in gives us a chance to take stock of how everyone’s feeling, clarify group work expectations, and revisit some early course reminders.</p>

	<h2>☁️ Mood Check: A Bit Cloudy</h2>
	<p>This week’s mood was a mixed forecast — but leaning toward overcast skies:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="emoji">☀️</span> Sunshine: <strong>28%</strong></li>
		<li><span class="emoji">☁️</span> Cloudy: <strong>36%</strong></li>
		<li><span class="emoji">🌧️</span> Rainy: <strong>23%</strong></li>
		<li><span class="emoji">⛈️</span> Thundery: <strong>13%</strong></li>
		<li><span class="emoji">🌈</span> Rainbow: <strong>0%</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you're feeling stuck in the drizzle, you're not alone — and there's still time to regroup. More on that below!</p>

	<h2>🧭 Avoiding the “5 Mistakes”: Let’s Get Specific</h2>
	<p>Survey responses show that only <strong>36%</strong> of the class feels they’re doing <em>very well or better</em> at avoiding the common pitfalls from Week 1. Let’s break them down with quick reminders and tips:</p>

	<h3>⏱ Time & Pacing Mistakes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>📆 <strong>Skipping check-ins</strong> means I can’t support you early — these help me identify patterns and offer feedback before you fall too far behind.</li>
		<li>⚠️ <strong>Missing the end of the grace period</strong> = a potential 0. Some assignments (especially group-related) must be submitted before the grace window closes.</li>
		<li>📉 <strong>Assuming you’ll “catch up later”</strong> is risky. Consistent progress each week helps avoid last-minute stress and missed credits.</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="highlight">
		✅ <strong>Tip:</strong> Block out two or three short “writing work sessions” each week. Even 30–45 minutes can make a big difference.
	</div>

	<h3>📝 Submission & Revision Mistakes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>✔️ <strong>A Complete = meets all assignment requirements.</strong> Submitting something rushed or incomplete won’t earn credit.</li>
		<li>🛠️ <strong>No time for revision = trouble.</strong> Feedback helps you succeed — but only if you build in time to revise.</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="highlight">
		✅ <strong>Tip:</strong> After you submit an assignment, schedule a 15-minute window to review my feedback and plan one revision step.
	</div>

	<h2>🤝 Group Proposals: Getting Clearer</h2>
	<p>Many of you are getting a strong handle on what to do for your part of the recommendation report:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>54%</strong> – Understand the task but still figuring out how to write it</li>
		<li><strong>21%</strong> – Confident and even thinking ahead about presentation</li>
		<li><strong>23%</strong> – Some clarity, but still unsure about parts</li>
		<li><strong>3%</strong> – Feeling lost (don’t stay there — reach out!)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you're still unsure, check in with your team, revisit the proposal resources, or ask questions in class or on Canvas.</p>

	<h2>✅ Looking Ahead</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>🔍 Finalize your group's proposal draft — clarity and alignment are key!</li>
		<li>🗓️ Keep pace with weekly deliverables — avoid bottlenecks before Spring gets too hectic</li>
		<li>💬 Watch for peer feedback prompts coming soon</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>🔑 Key Takeaways</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>⛅ Most students are feeling a little cloudy — stay connected and ask for help if you're stuck.</li>
		<li>📋 Only one-third of the class is avoiding the “5 mistakes” well — check in with your habits and course pacing.</li>
		<li>🧠 Most of you understand your group project role — now focus on turning ideas into strong, clear writing.</li>
		<li>🔄 Build in time for revision — it’s key to earning a Complete and making your writing stronger.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Thanks for reading — and keep up the thoughtful work!</p>
