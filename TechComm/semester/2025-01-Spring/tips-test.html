    <p>We are a little over two weeks from the last day of the course, so I want to remind you how to check on your grade in the course. The information I am sharing comes from our <em>Technical Writing Course Manual</em>. You can check the manual for more details as needed.</p>
    <h3>How to Determine Your Current Grade
    </h3>
    <p>Because of the way Canvas has been programmed, your current grade in the course is not accurate. In the screenshot below, for instance, Test Student&lsquo;s grade shows as a C+. That calculation is incorrect. Follow these instructions to determine your actual grade.</p>
    <p>Go to <strong>Grades</strong> in Canvas, and find your total number of points in the upper right (outlined in yellow in the screenshot below). In this case, Test Student only has 6723 points.</p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 24px;">Compare Your Current Number of Points to the Grade Scale</h4>
    <p>Determine your current grade by checking your current number of points to the information in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJg9RoMQ31UQRcPeZuLFjGFjG25uosrG5AFw2IeW2c8/edit#heading=h.mtsl8kq0seid" target="_blank">Points and Grade Scale in the Course Manual</a>. Since Test Student has 6723 points, she falls in the D+ range for her course grade:</p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 24px;">Continue Your Work in the Course</h4>
    <p>Your points total in the course cannot be any lower than it is right now. For instance, Test Student has a D+ locked in. Her grade will not be any lower.</p>
    <p>As you complete the remaining work in the course, your points total will rise. You can decide what work to complete based on your goal for the course.</p>
    <h3>My Progress on Grading Your Work</h3>
    <p>We are in the middle of the longest assignment in the course, which I have broken out into section-by-section assignments to help ensure everyone includes all the required parts of the report. </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, that means that I have nearly 300 submissions in the queue to grade. I am working through them as quickly as I can, but it will take some time to respond to all of them. And of course, more submissions are coming in every day.</p>
    <p>As a guideline, <strong>allow me a week</strong> to add relevant points to your Grades in Canvas. If your work does not meet the requirements, you will have the chance to revise and resubmit. </p>
