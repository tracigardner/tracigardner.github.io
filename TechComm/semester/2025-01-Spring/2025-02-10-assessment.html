    <h3 style="color: #861f41;font-weight: bold;border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41;">Group Discussions Worries</h3>
    <p>Some of you have written me about difficulty connecting with the members of your group. Last week was our first time connecting in project groups, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that there have been a few bumps.</p>

    <p>The most typical hiccup happens when some group members decide to use the 3-Day Grace Period, leaving others who are trying to get everything done by the Target Due Date unable to do so.</p>

    <h4 style="color: #e5751f;font-weight: bold;font-size: 21px;">Solution to Group Discussion Worries</h4>
    <p>Since this is the first time your project groups have collaborated, I am extending the end of the grace period to Friday, February 14 (not the greatest Valentine&rsquo;s Day present, I know ❤️). Everyone should be able to connect with their groups given this extra time.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #861f41;font-weight: bold;border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41;margin-top: 24px;">Weekly Activities Completes</h3>
    <p>If your work meet the expectations for the Try-Its and Introduce Yourself Discussion, I have marked it Complete. About half of the class falls in this category.</p>

    <p>If I have not marked your work Complete, either you haven&rsquo;t submitted yet OR you didn&rsquo;t meet the expectations. All three activities (the two Try-Its and the Introduce Yourself Discussion) require more than one reply. Look at the Assessments section at the bottom of the instructions for each Discussions for details.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #861f41;font-weight: bold;border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41;margin-top: 24px;">Feedback on the Survey of Website Writing</h3>
    <p>I&rsquo;ll start adding feedback to your first Major Project later this evening. You will usually find feedback in the project rubric and in annotations on the PDF you submitted. See the &ldquo;How to Find Feedback After Your Submit Your Work&rdquo; section of <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/assignments/2273825" target="_blank">the Assignment</a> for more details.</p>
