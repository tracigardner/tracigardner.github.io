        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>English 3764: Technical Writing will enable you to gain an understanding of the theories, issues, and practices of technical communications you might encounter as in the workplace, such as general correspondence, proposals, reports, and presentations.</p>
        <p>From a foundation based on the principles of rhetoric, you will learn to analyze writing situations, consider the needs of your audience, assemble researched and original evidence, and design final documents that are user friendly and visually persuasive. By the time this course is over, you should be able not only to understand these documents, but also to produce them with ease and with confidence.</p>
        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
        <p>Having successfully completed this course, students will be able to perform the technical writing tasks defined by the learning objectives for the course:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze the rhetorical situation and determine the appropriate audience or users of written communication, considering the needs of global audiences and people with disabilities.</li>
            <li>Conduct research appropriate to workplace problem solving, such as literature review, evaluation of online resources, interview, and site inspection.</li>
            <li>Interpret research findings with understanding of ethical and human implications.</li>
            <li>Use conventions of various workplace genres, such as proposals, instructions, correspondence, reports, and slide decks, with understanding of how the genre conventions can be used as heuristics and as principles of arrangement.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with classmates in planning, researching, writing, revising, and presenting information.</li>
            <li>Apply principles of effective visual design for print and electronic presentation, including hierarchical, chronological, and spatial arrangements.</li>
            <li>Identify and apply the principles of effective style in the composing of usable, reader-centered written communications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Course Calendar</h3>
        <p>You can access the assignments for this course in three ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>at the bottom of the Syllabus page (this page)</li>
            <li>on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/assignments" target="_blank">Assignments page</a></li>
            <li>via the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/course-calendar-fall-2023" target="_blank">Course Calendar</a>, which lists dates for assignments and readings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first two sources do not provide links to readings for each assignment. You will find those only on the Course Calendar, so I encourage you to make it your go-to source.</p>

        <h3>Course Structure</h3>
        <p>This course consists of weekly modules. Each one of those modules may include additional resource modules that supplement textbook readings and serve as ready-references.</p>
        <p>Assignment links are found on the Course Calendar and at the bottom of the syllabus page.</p>

        <h3>Course Expectations</h3>
        <p>This course is 100% virtual; that is, we will never meet in the classroom. As a result, it is important that you understand how the course will be conducted and what will be expected of you as a student enrolled in it.</p>
        <p>As your teacher, it is my responsibility to (among other things)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Answer any questions you might have that are not covered by the textbook or another reading,</li>
            <li>Provide feedback to you about your work,</li>
            <li>Grade your work as promptly as possible,</li>
            <li>Use a grading rubric to help explain your grades,</li>
            <li>Update your grades on Canvas, and</li>
            <li>Inform you promptly of any alterations to the schedule, such as due date changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That said, in order to do well in this course, you must follow these policies:</p>
        <h4>Read All Announcements</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Announcements are the primary way I keep in touch with you, so it's imperative that you read every single one in its entirety. Not reading announcements will not be an excuse for not submitting work on time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Be Aware of Due Dates/Times</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Most (if not all) assignments are set to be due by 11:59 pm. You can, of course, upload your work earlier. All work should be uploaded in the appropriate manner to the appropriate page on the Canvas site.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Read All Materials and Review Examples</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Specific chapters were chosen from three different Open Educational Resource textbooks to give you the best possible introduction to the material. Our Canvas site also includes course-specific resource modules. Please ensure that you read all of this material before working on assignments.</li>
            <li>You will also find sample documents to most major assignment pages and some homework assignments. Review them. Pay attention to them. Many of them are real "A" level documents produced in this course.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Apply What You are Learning</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Do your best to apply what you have read and the lessons you have learned from reviewing examples to producing and improving your own work.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Follow Assignment Instructions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Each assignment provides you with a description of the deliverable and the specifications, including page length, formatting, and other requirements. Assignments other than discussions include checklists that are designed to help you cover all requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Conduct Yourself Professionally</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For this course, just as for one that meets in a classroom, you are expected to be civil to other participants and to the instructor, to apply what you are learning about professional correspondence to any messages or discussion posts, and to contribute conscientiously to any discussions and group assignments.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Course Policies</h3>
        <h4>Absences</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Granted, it is difficult to take roll in an online course that has no set meeting times. However, it is somewhat common to get overwhelmed, particularly if you are taking more than one online course. Sometimes, students even disappear (so to speak) from online classes. And that's truly what being absent means in a class that meets virtually: to go missing.</li>
            <li>Don't disappear and expect to make up missed work (daily work or major assignments). If you do disappear, expect that you will have to go to your dean (in person or via email) to provide me with an excuse before I will accept any missed work. If you cannot provide me with a legit excuse via your dean, the missed work will be entered as a zero (or zeroes).</li>
            <li>In the end, you will get the grade you get. If you decide to skip three major assignments and all homework, that's okay with me, as long as you realize you will not be permitted to make it up without documentation.</li>
            <li>If circumstances prevent participation or timely completion of assignments, you must contact me in advance of due dates.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Incompletes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Incompletes are given only in provable emergency situations -- and only if you have completed at least 75% of the coursework. Incompletes will not be given in situations where you might have disappeared early in the class and then reappeared later. Be aware of drop and withdrawal dates.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Participation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Participants in this course should expect to spend about 8-10 hours per week involved in the activities and completion of assignments over the semester. This is similar to the time one would invest in a course in a traditional classroom setting.</li>
            <li>This time invested is an average, with some weeks requiring more and some less time to complete all assignments and activities. Participation will be evaluated as the completion of all activities within the unit or module period.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Community, Principles of</h4>
        <p>This course adheres to the <a href="https://www.inclusive.vt.edu/about/vtpoc.html">Virginia Tech Principles of Community</a>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We affirm the inherent dignity and value of every person and strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual respect and understanding.</li>
            <li>We affirm the right of each person to express thoughts and opinions freely.</li>
            <li>We encourage open expression within a climate of civility, sensitivity, and mutual respect.</li>
            <li>We affirm the value of human diversity because it enriches our lives and the University. We acknowledge and respect our differences while affirming our common humanity.</li>
            <li>We reject all forms of prejudice and discrimination, including those based on age, color, disability, gender, national origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, and veteran status. We take individual and collective responsibility for helping to eliminate bias and discrimination and for increasing our own understanding of these issues through education, training, and interaction with others.</li>
            <li>We pledge our collective commitment to these principles in the spirit of the Virginia Tech motto of <em>Ut Prosim</em> (That I May Serve).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Honor Code</h4>
        <p>The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.</em></p>
        <p>Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code. For additional information about the Honor Code, please visit <a href="https://honorsystem.vt.edu/">The Office of Undergraduate Academic Integrity</a> (104 Hillcrest; 231-9876).</p>
