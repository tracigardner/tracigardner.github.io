            <h2>Grace Period by Assignment Type</h2>
            <ul>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Check-Ins</strong>: Short, 3-day grace period. Their Target Due Date each week is on Friday, and the Grace Period ends on the following Wednesday. <em>Why?</em> Because Check-Ins tell me how things are going at a particular point in time. They lose their usefulness if the response is delayed.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Try-It Discussions</strong>: Short, 3-day grace period. Their Target Due Date each week is on Friday, and the Grace Period ends on the following Wednesday. <em>Why?</em> Because Discussions need to take place in a timely manner. You can&rsquo;t carry on a conversation unless everyone participates at the same time.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Try-Its from Weeks 2 to 6 (other than Try-It Discussions)</strong>: Open grace period that ends on December 1. <em>Why?</em> Because these are individual activities that do not depend upon anyone else in the class.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Try-Its from Week 7 to the end of the term</strong>: Short, 3-day grace period. Their Target Due Date each week is on Friday, and the Grace Period ends on the following Wednesday. <em>Why?</em> Because of the impact these Try-Its have on group writing projects. Group work has to keep on track so that everyone in the group can participate and finish the projects on time.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>The first two Major Projects (the Survey and the User Documentation Revision and Memo)</strong>: Open grace period that ends on December 1. <em>Why?</em> Because these are individual activities that do not depend upon anyone else in the class.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>The remaining three Major Projects (the Proposal, the Progress Report, and the Recommendation Report)</strong>: Writing groups agree on the end of the grace period. Everyone in the group must have their work turned in by the dates that the groups choose. <em>Why?</em> Because these are group writing projects, everyone has to participate and finish the projects on time.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>The final exam</strong>: No grace period. If you choose to submit the optional final, you must submit it by the end of the exam week. <em>Why?</em> The university expects the end of exam week to be the last moment that exams can be submitted.</li>

                    For all of these types of assignments, the Target Due Date each week is on Friday, and the Grace Period ends on the following Wednesday. <em>Why?</em> Because these assignments must be completed in a timely manner.
