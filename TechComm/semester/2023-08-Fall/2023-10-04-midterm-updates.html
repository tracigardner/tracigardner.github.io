    <h1>Midterm Class Updates &amp; Changes</h1>

    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve reached the middle of the term, so I want to provide some updates on what&rsquo;s going on in the course, some resources that I&rsquo;m working on, and some changes I&rsquo;m making.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e87722;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">What&rsquo;s Going On</h2>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve probably noticed that I&rsquo;m behind on sending you <strong style="color: #861f41;">feedback on your work</strong>. My goal is to send out feedback on the first and second Major Projects by the end of the week. I&rsquo;ll respond to this week&rsquo;s Try-Its (#13 &amp; #14) next week.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m also behind in responding to <strong style="color: #861f41;">your Canvas Inbox messages and email messages.</strong> I plan to get all those taken care of today. If you don&rsquo;t have a response by Thursday morning, please send me another message. I likely missorted yours or thought I had already answered it.</p>

    <p>TL;DR part: I got bogged down working on posting all of the remaining Major Project assignments and fell behind. I apologize for that.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e87722;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">Coming Resources</h2>
    <p>I&rsquo;m sure you have concerns about the group work that the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/discussion_topics/1720228" target="_blank">Group FAQ</a> doesn&rsquo;t address. I&rsquo;m working on some <strong style="color: #861f41;">guidelines for common group situations</strong> that may come up, such as a group member who is not participating. I still want you to follow the expectations that you outline in your Teamwork Contract, but I also want you to have a transparent system for what will happen and what you can do.</p>

    <p>I have additional <strong style="color: #861f41;">instructions for all of the parts of the Recommendation Report.</strong> There&rsquo;s a section of the assignment that has a shaded background and a note that says the links are forthcoming. I'm working on it. I just need to update the links; however, adding feedback to your work from earlier in this term needs to come first. Look for those missing pages next week. </p>

    <p>You may not have noticed, but you have been <strong style="color: #861f41;">earning Badges</strong> as you submit all the work for each week of the course. I&rsquo;ll share details on these Badges and some others that I will add before the end of the term in the next week or two. Think of the badges as something like stickers. They&lsquo&rsquo;re also an easy way to see if you&rsquo;ve turned in all the work for each week. If you want to see your progress, use the <strong style="color: #861f41;">Credentials</strong> link in the Canvas sidebar. </p>

    <h2 style="color: #e87722;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">Changes I&rsquo;m Making</h2>
    <p>The majority of things in the course are proceeding as they have been, but I need to make one significant change to ensure that group work goes smoothly:</p>

    <div style="margin: 12px 40px 12px 40px;padding: 6px 15px;border:3px double #e87722;background-color: #f9f9fa;">
        <p>The <strong style="color: #861f41;">weekly Try-It activities</strong> from this week on (beginning with Try-It #13 &amp; #14) <strong style="color: #861f41;">will all have a short grace period of 3 working days.</strong> The Try-Its are due on Friday, and their grace period will end on the following Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Why? Since the Try-Its relate directly to the work groups are doing, you need to complete them in a timely manner. It&rsquo;s not fair to group members to have to wait until December for someone to weigh in on an activity that will impact the Major Project they are working on. Additionally, I hope that the weekly activities will help keep the groups on track to turn in their projects close to the Target Due Dates.</p>
    </div>

    <p>I don&rsquo;t plan on making any changes to the Major Projects grace period right now. If something changes, I&rsquo;ll let you know.</p>

    <p>One other minor change to mention: The details for this week say that I&rsquo;m taking Fall Break and this weekend off, but I will likely be working anyway. I want to try to get ahead so that I can give you faster responses and feedback. If you get a message from me or feedback on your work at 3 AM this weekend, please understand that I&rsquo;m just trying to catch up. It&rsquo;s not that I expect YOU to be working all weekend. Take a break! I&rsquo;m sure you need one.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e87722;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">Questions or Concerns?</h2>
    <p>That&rsquo;s all I have for now. If you have a question, you can add a reply below and I&rsquo;ll take care of it. Everyone in the class can read replies to this announcement. If you have a private question, send me a message with the Canvas Inbox instead.</p>
