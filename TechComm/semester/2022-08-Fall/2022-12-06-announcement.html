    <h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Grades Posted, Based on Effort Expectations</span></h2>
<p>All submitted work has been marked and returned in Canvas. The Grace Period for all work closed on Friday, December 2. No further work can be revised or submitted.</p>
<p>I have completed the Effort Expectations rubric for everyone in the course, based on the <a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2022-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall22.pdf#page=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Effort Expectations chart</a>. Check your grade for the <a title="Effort Expectations-Based Course Grade" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/assignments/1518750" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/151634/assignments/1485582" data-api-returntype="Assignment">Effort Expectations-Based Course Grade Assignment</a> to see your current course grade.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Deciding Whether to Take the Final Exam</span></h2>
<p>You have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you agree with the grade indicated for the<span> <a title="Effort Expectations-Based Course Grade" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/assignments/1518750" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/151634/assignments/1485582" data-api-returntype="Assignment">Effort Expectations-Based Course Grade Assignment</a></span></strong>, do nothing. The grade in the rubric will become your course grade. You can skip the final exam.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>If you disagree&nbsp; with the grade indicated for the<span> <a title="Effort Expectations-Based Course Grade" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156996/assignments/1518750" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/151634/assignments/1485582" data-api-returntype="Assignment">Effort Expectations-Based Course Grade Assignment</a> </span>and want to propose a different grade</strong>, complete the final exam to argue for the grade you believe you deserve <strong>by 11:59PM on Wednesday, December 14, 2022.</strong> Use the information in the rubric as the baseline for the course grade you propose in your Final Exam. Your course grade will be indicated as the grade on the final exam.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have set up the Grades page to show your course grade as the letter grade in the rubric. If you choose to take the final, that grade may change, depending upon your proposal.</p>
