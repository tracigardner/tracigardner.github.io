    <p>In this course, you will compose a series of documents that contribute to a collection on food- related information for college students. This sequence of projects will be your focus for the term.</p>
    <h4 style="clear: both;">Introduce Yourself &amp; Share a Food Story</h4>
    <p> <img src="../../-images/noun-food-story-color.png" width="100" height="101" class="alignright" alt="In the background, a profile page showing a user, and in the foreground, a maroon and orange bowl full of bread" />You will create an introduction video presentation that tells the class who you are and shares a personal food story. Your video should be 3 to 5 minutes long and should show either yourself talking to the audience or slides that illustrate your story.</p>
    <p> You will share your presentation with the entire class in Canvas.</p>
    <h4 style="clear: both;">Pitch Your Recommendation Report Topic</h4>
    <p><img class="alignright" src="../../-images/noun-request-for-proposal-color.png" width="100" height="96" alt="A proposal document showing a graphic of an orange-frosted donut with maroon sprinkles" />You will pitch your recommendation topic in a one-page memo that describes your topic. Your memo will use memo headings and fill at least ¾ of the page.</p>
    <p> You will explain your topic, why you chose it, and why your readers will be interested. The memo should also include details on your planned research on the topic. You will share your proposal memo with Traci only.</p>
    <h4 style="clear: both;">Write a Technical Description</h4>
    <p> <img class="alignright" src="../../-images/noun-user-guide-color.png" width="72" height="100" alt="A spiral-bound notebook showing a document with an image of hops" style="margin-right: 12px;" />You will choose an object or process related to food and compose a technical description in the form of a fact or info sheet. Objects can include tools (e.g., wok, mortar and pestle), ingredients (e.g., ginger, hops), and food items (e.g., uramaki, Chicken Kyiv). Processes can include julienning, fermenting, and fertilizing.</p>
    <p> You will include specific details and relevant illustrations that describe the item or process is, how it works, and its principal parts or steps. You will share your technical description with the class.</p>
    <h4 style="clear: both;">Compose Instructions</h4>
    <p><img src="../../-images/noun-cooking-recipes-website-color.png" width="98" height="100" alt="A tablet screen showing a video with an orange mixing bowl full of batter and a wooden spoon" class="alignright" />You will create instructions for how to prepare, grow, select, or serve food. Your project can be a recipe, but you are not limited to recipes. You can also focus on topics such as how to pair a beer with a meal, how to harvest strawberries, how to choose the fresh produce, or how to season a cast iron skillet.</p>
    <p> You will write numbered steps, using action verbs in the imperative mood. If used in the instructions, you can link to technical descriptions of objects or processes. Your project will include photos or illustrations demonstrating the steps. You will share your instructions with the class.</p>
    <h4 style="clear: both;">Make Your Recommendation</h4>
    <p><img src="../../-images/noun-analysis-1118688-861F41.png" width="100" height="96" alt="A page from a report showing an image of a bag of groceries and text, with a yellow pencil beside the paper." class="alignright" />You will identify a food-related challenge that Virginia Tech students face, investigate solutions, and make a recommendation to your readers. You will have a range of projects to focus on, including recommendations on decreasing grocery bills, eating vegan on campus, optimizing food truck access, and addressing food insecurity.</p>
    <p>You will include customary sections (e.g., intro, methods, results, conclusions, and recommendations), along with front and back matter. Your report will be 10–15 pages long. You will share your instructions with the class.</p>
