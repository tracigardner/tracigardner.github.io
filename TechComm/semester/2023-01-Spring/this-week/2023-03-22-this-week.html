         <h3>Thanks for Your Feedback</h3>
            <p>This week‚Äôs newsletter focuses  on the feedback  you gave me  in the Week 7 Check-in Survey. That was the survey for the week before Spring Break, and I asked you to assess things   at the mid-point in the course. It took some time to work through  the responses. I hope I  hit all the main points of your responses. If there‚Äôs anything else you want to tell me, you can send me a message or use the <a href="https://forms.gle/fftB6YmWQoz5z6Hb6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anonymous Questions &amp; Suggestions form</a>.</p>

      <h3>The Course Focus on Food</h3>

Hate would not be a strong enough word for this person.</p>
      <p>I‚Äôd like to talk to this person and try to improve things for them, but all the Check-In Surveys are anonymous. I don‚Äôt know who the person is. I do have a clue because of a specific topic that is mentioned, but I don‚Äôt have  enough to be sure.</p>
      <p>If you are the very unhappy person, please send me a message through Canvas so that we can negotiate a way forward for you.</p>

      <h3>Looking Good in a Presentation</h3>
      <p>If you are planning to include a thumbnail of yourself talking in your presentation, Jessica Chen‚Äôs LinkedIn Learning video on ‚Äú<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/media-training-essentials/presenting-effectively-on-camera?autoplay=true&u=57888345" target="_blank">Presenting effectively on camera</a>‚Äù (4m 5s) includes advice on how to look good in your video. The other videos in her course are also useful, so browse the titles for others that will help you.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

      <p>The Check-In Survey before Spring Break asked you what was helping you the most in this course. The bar chart on the left shows the most frequent answers you gave.</p>
      <p>Student examples for the full drafts was mentioned most frequently. The grace period came in a close second. So I will definitely keep those options in place.</p>
      <p>The only surprise in the feedback was that someone suggested Spring Break was going to help the most. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt take credit for that. </p>
