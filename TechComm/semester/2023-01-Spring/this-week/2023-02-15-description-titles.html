    <div class="col-sm-5 trow-right">
      <p>These titles all have a subject and scope. They all “clearly state the subject and indicate whether the description is general or particular” (Markel, p. 563).</p>
      <p>They will all work for technical descriptions.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>Clever and Clear</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ice Cream Scoop - Here's the scoop</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-5 trow-right">
      <p>As long as the reader undestands that the word <em>scoop</em> can mean “all the details” this title works just fine for a technical description.</p>

  <div class="row trow">
    <div class="col-sm-7">
      <h3>Subject, but Not Scope</h3>
      <ul>

        <li>Microwaves: College students’ best friend</li>
        <li>Refrigerator - The coldest appliance</li>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-5 trow-right">
      <p>These titles are off to a good start. They all include a subject, so the reader knows exactly what object the document is about.</p>
      <p>The reader cannot tell however what the document will tell us about the item. Will it be instructions on how to use the object? Is it a recommendation on the best object to use? Will the document complain about the object? There’s no way for the reader to know.</p>
      <p>Before using any of these titles, the writers need to add details that tel the reader what the document will say about the object.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Air Fryer Technicality</dt>
        <dd>The word <em>technicality</em> seems off here. Usually a technicality is a specific and very technical detail. In legal TV shows and movies, people can “get off on a technicality.” That is not what the writer likely means. This title needs to more clearly indicate that the document is a technical description.</dd>
        <dt>Corkscrew the cork</dt>
        <dd>I’m not quite sure what the writer is going for here. I’m not sure if this title is incomplete or there’s something else going on. This title definitely needs more information to indicate the subject and scope.</dd>
        <dt>Everything there is to know about Coors Light</dt>
        <dd>Everything? Probably not. This title needs to be clearer about exactly what the reader is going to find out about Coors Light.</dd>
        <dt>Let's Get the Cookin!</dt>
        <dd>I see two possibilities here. (1) “The Cookin” is some object that I’ve never heard of that this document will talk about, OR (2) The writer meant “Let’s Get Cookin’!” Whether it is one of those two options or something else altogether, this working title needs to be revised so that the reader can tell what object the document is about and that this document is a technical description.</dd>
        <dt>Sizzlin cast Iron</dt>
        <dd>I’m not sure what this working title is about either. Surely not all the cast iron in existence, and I can’t find any object with that name. It seems as though more information would clear things up. For instance, Sizzlin’ Cast Iron Skillet would have let me know exactly what object the document would talk about. The title also needs some details to tell the reader that the document is a technical description.</dd>
        <dt>The spatula and all its glory details</dt>
        <dd>It’s clear that this working title is about a spatula. What I’m not sure about is the second part of the title: “all its glory details”? Maybe it uses the wrong word? Gloriful would make more sense, if that is what the writer means. Whatever the writer means, this title could use a clearer statement of the topic and some details that tell the reader this will be a technical description.</dd>

      <h3>These Working Titles Suggest the Document Is on the Wrong Topic</h3>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <dt>Description and Instructions for an Electric Milk Frother</dt>
      <dd>The assignment is to write a technical description. The Instructions are a second, separate document.</dd>
      <dt>How the use of Can openers helps our cooking<br />
          The Best Uses for Tostitos<br />
          Cooking Knives and Their Many Uses Explored</dt>
      <dd>These three working titles suggest that the document is about uses of the object. The assignment focuses on technical description however. These titles need to state the subject and scope more clearly so the reader knows what to expect in the document.</dd>
        
      <dt>If you’re looking for powerADE you have come to the right place. </dt>
      <dd>This working title suggests that the document will be about how to find Powerade. The writer appears to be trying for a clever title, but it doesn’t make it clear that this document will be a technical description.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</dd>

      <dt>Label Analysis Report of Rao's Tomato Sauce<br />
          A Technical Analysis of a Spatula<br />
          Functional Analysis of Water Purifier<br />
          Analysis of the Kroger Fruit &amp; Grain bar</dt>
      <dd>These working titles indicate what object the document is about, but they all indicate that the document will provide an analysis. The assignment is to write a technical description. These working titles need revised to clarify what the document will tell the reader about the object.&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
  
      <dt>Technical description of an airplane<br />
        The Airplane- a vehicle that is able to leave the ground on its own power resulting in flight</dt>
      <dd>These two working titles tell me that the writers are on the wrong topic altogether. The assignment is to write about an item related to food. An airplane doesn’t fit the assignment. Check the list of examples on <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/166227/assignments/1668903" target="_blank">the assignment page</a> topics that work.</dd>
