     <h2>Strong Titles</h2>
     <p>These titles all make it clear the document focuses on recommendations. They clearly include a form of the word, which provides the purpose for the document. The rest of the title explains the subject.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Recommendations for Buying Meal Options for Students who Live Off-Campus</li>
      <li>Recommendation Report for the Use of Air Fryers by Virginia Tech Students</li>
      <li>Recommendation for Aid to Off-Campus Students to Improve their Dietary Habits</li>

      <li>Saving Time in the Kitchen as Busy College Students: A Recommendation Report</li>
      <li>Recommendations for Supporting Plant Based Eating on Campus</li>
     </ul>
     <p>These titles have a clear subject and purpose. Even though they do not use a form of the word <em>recommend</em>, the reader can tell the document is providing information on how to do something.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>What Virginia Tech can do about the long lines in Dining halls</li>
      <li>Improving Vegetarian Options on Campus</li>

      <h2>Titles that Need Improvement</h2>
       <p>This title includes a subject and a purpose. To improve it, tighten the phrasing to make the title more concise. Check Markel &amp; Selber, ‚ÄúBe Concise,‚Äù pp. 240‚Äì244, for ideas on how to revise.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>How to eat for cheap as a college student at Virginia Tech</li>
     </ul>
<p>This title seems more like the title for a research article than for a recommendation report. It‚Äôs making an informative statement. To improve it, rephrase so that it‚Äôs clear to the reader that the document is a recommendation report.</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Lack Of Cooking Skills And Healthy Meal Planning Knowledge Can Cause Poor Health And Debt In Students</li>
        </ul>

  </div>
  <div class="row">
   <div class="col-sm-12">
     <h2>Titles without a Clear Audience</h2>
     <p>Compare the titles in Group One to those in Group Two. Do you see the difference? For those in Group One, the reader doesn‚Äôt know who the audience is: will the document talk about</p>
     <ul class="null">
      <li>everyone in the world?</li>
      <li>a specific age group (e.g. senior citizens, young families)?</li>
      <li>people in a particular location?</li>
      <li>people on a specific eating plan?</li>
     </ul>
     <p>See the issue? The titles in Group One are more general than those in Group Two. If your title is in Group One, revise to make it more specific. If your title is in Group Two, it‚Äôs ready to use.</p>
     <h3>Group One</h3>
     <ul class="null">
      <li>Recommendations for Decreasing your Grocery Bill</li>
      <li>Reducing Your Grocery Bill</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Group Two</h3>
     <ul class="null">
      <li>Recommendations for Decreasing Grocery Bills for Virginia Tech Students</li>
      <li>Reducing the Grocery Bill for Virginia Tech Students</li>
     </ul>

      <h2>Incomplete Titles</h2>
     <p>These titles all have a subject, but not a purpose. They don‚Äôt tell the reader why you‚Äôre examining the topic.</p>
     <p>They also need to be more precise. There‚Äôs no indication that the document will include recommendations.</p>
     <p>Check Markel &amp; Selber, ‚ÄúWriting Clear, Informative Titles,‚Äù pp. 198‚Äì199, for a specific explanation of these suggestions.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Virginia Tech‚Äôs fruit offering issue </li>
      <li>Guide to Vegan Dining at Virginia Tech</li>
      <li>Addition of Grocery Shopping Workshops and Courses for Virginia Tech Students</li>
      <li>Food Insecurity: Why You Should Care</li>
      <li>Investigating Food Insecurity for Virginia Tech Students</li>
      <li>Intermittent Fasting and Proper Dieting for Virginia Tech Students</li>
      <li>Following a Vegetarian Diet at Virginia Tech </li>
     </ul>

   <div class="col-sm-12">
     <h2>Off-Topic Titles</h2>
     <p>These titles suggest that the Recommendation Report does not meet the requirements of the assignment. The assignment is to do the following:</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 24px;">For your Recommendation Report, you will identify a food-related challenge that Virginia Tech students face, investigate solutions, and make a recommendation to an appropriate audience (such as Virginia Tech students, the Dean of Students, or the President).</p>
     <p>These topics have nothing to do with the assigned topic. For more information, visit the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/166227/pages/recommendation-report-topic" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Topic page</a>.</p>
     <ul>
