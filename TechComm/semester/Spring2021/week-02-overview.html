<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" src="../../-images/null-by-beryl-chan.jpg" alt="Asian woman reading text on an iPad" />Technical writing is any kind of writing you might be called upon to produce for an audience in your particular workplace. The term refers not only to complex, lengthy, heavily-illustrated documents like reports and user guides, but also to shorter pieces of writing like memos, letters, and progress reports.</p>
<p>But guess what? Technical writing can take place outside the workplace as well: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Ever write down a recipe for someone? </li>
  <li>Tell someone how to get somewhere? </li>
  <li>Describe the exact tool to use for a project? </li>
  <li>Explain how to play a game? </li>
  <li>Persuade someone to buy a particular item? </li>
  <li>Outline the rules for a particular D&amp;D setting?</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these kinds of communicating are technical writing‚Äîand I bet you have a lot of experience with that kind of technical writing.</p>
<p>This week‚Äôs activities introduce you not only to the concept of technical writing in general but also to several foundational principles upon which your writing for this course should be built: the characteristics of technical communication, audience analysis, and ethics.</p>
