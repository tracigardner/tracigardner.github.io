<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" src="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/files/16639777/download" alt="Asian woman reading text on an iPad" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/126055/files/16639777" data-api-returntype="File" />Technical writing is any kind of writing you might be called upon to produce for an audience in your particular workplace, whether you are training to be a technical writer, computer scientist, an electrical engineer, a biochemist, a financial consultant, or something else. The term refers not only to complex, lengthy, heavily-illustrated documents like reports and user guides, but also to shorter pieces of writing like memos, letters, and progress reports.</p>
<p>But guess what? Technical writing can take place outside the workplace as well‚Äîand you have a lot of experience with that kind of technical writing.</p>
<p><strong>Recipes, directions, descriptions, apprenticeships, persuasion</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Society for Technical Communication</a>, a professional society to which many professional and technical writers belong, defines such writing as</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicating about technical or specialized topics, such as computer applications, medical procedures, or environmental regulations.</li>
<li>Communicating by using technology, such as web sites, help files, or social media sites.</li>
<li>Providing instructions about how to do something, regardless of how technical the task is or even if technology is used to create or distribute that information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical writing tasks might extend&mdash;depending upon your career&mdash;to designing user documentation, producing white papers for a product or service, or setting up and maintaining web sites, from text to visuals to code.&nbsp; Technical writing is anything you do as a writer&nbsp;in your field, regardless of whether you are a scientist, an engineer, an architect, or a high school teacher.&nbsp;<br /><br />This module introduces you not only to the concept of professional writing in general but also to several foundational principles upon which your writing for this course should be built: the characteristics of technical communication, audience analysis, and ethics.</p>
