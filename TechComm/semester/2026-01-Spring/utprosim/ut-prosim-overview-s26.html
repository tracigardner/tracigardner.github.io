                <p>You&rsquo;ll focus on one topic all semester as you write a series of six different documents. This focus will make the course easier for you in these ways:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 24px;" class="skipline">
                    <li>You&rsquo;ll <strong>research one topic</strong> and then use that information for all your writing. </li>
                    <li>You&rsquo;ll <strong>build on what you know and learn</strong> about the topic (rather than having to start over for each project).</li>
                    <li>You&rsquo;ll be able to <strong>reuse portions of your writing</strong>, making the most of what you write for the course.</li>
                    <li>You&rsquo;ll <strong>adapt portions of your writing</strong> as you address new purposes and readers, so you&rsquo;ll spend less time starting from scratch.</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2026-01-Spring/utprosim/Torg-Bridge-PaulKurlak-utprosim-detail.jpg" alt="Detail from Torgerson Bridge showing the center windows on the drillfield side, with the words Ut Prosim carved into the Hokie Stone" style="float: right;margin: 12px;width: 322px;height: 333px;border: 3px solid #508590;border-radius: 6px;">

                <p>You probably know a bit about <em>Ut Prosim</em> (That I May Serve), Virginia Tech&rsquo;s motto.</p>

                <p><em>Ut Prosim</em> is not just part of the university logo; it is a guiding principle that shapes how Hokies approach learning, research, and professional life. This semester-long writing project is designed in that spirit.</p>

                <p>Over the course of this term, you will research, write, and design a series of interconnected documents about a subject rooted in your major that serves others and contributes to the greater good. Each assignment builds toward your ability to explain a complex topic clearly and accessibly to different real-world audiences, always with the goal of informing, guiding, or supporting action that contributes to fairness, accessibility, and the well-being of communities.</p>

                <p>In 1896, John McBryde &mdash; who was Virginia Tech's fifth president &mdash; assigned the motto that has come to identify the guiding principle of Virginia Tech: <em>Ut Prosim </em>(That I May Serve)<em>.&nbsp;</em>A <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2022/11/cm-service.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>2022 VT News article</strong></a> about the impact of this motto on Virginia Tech notes that while no one knows for certain why McBryde made this decision, his speeches "often reflected a desire for students to serve the interests of others." Today, this same article reports, this motto has been embraced by Hokies as a "timeless ideal of helping fellow humans and bettering the communities in which they live."</p>

                <p>In this course, you will come to see that technical writing puts that same <em>Ut Prosim</em> principle into everyday practice. At its best, technical writing is not just &ldquo;writing about technical stuff." Instead, it is writing that helps people <em data-start="292" data-end="297">use</em> information: to make decisions, follow a process, access services, stay safe, understand risks, or participate more fully in their workplaces and communities. Because technical documents often shape who can comply, who can benefit, and who gets left out, technical writers have an ethical responsibility to communicate in ways that reduce barriers rather than create them. Clear organization, plain language, thoughtful design, and audience awareness are all forms of service &mdash; especially when readers are busy, stressed, unfamiliar with the topic, or navigating systems that were not built with them in mind.</p>

                <p>Over the course of this term, you&rsquo;ll research, write, and design a series of interconnected documents about <strong>a socially-relevant subject connected to your major</strong>. Each assignment builds toward your ability to explain a complex topic clearly and accessibly to different real-world audiences &mdash; always with the goal of informing, guiding, or supporting action that contributes to equity, access, or social justice in communities. In other words, every major project you produce will be guided by the principle of <em>Ut Prosim </em>because it will serve the audience for whom you are writing it.</p>

                <p>You get to choose the subject on which you will focus your work this semester. The caveat is that it must be a technical object, practice, or idea within your field that has the potential to create a positive social impact. In the spirit of <em>Ut Prosim</em>, your topic should be:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Grounded in your major or area of study.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Clearly connected to community service, problem-solving, or public good.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Feasible to research and explain to multiple non-expert audiences.</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Examples include the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accessible design standards</strong> for public websites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water purification systems</strong> for underserved areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Renewable energy solutions</strong> for communities with limited resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assistive technologies</strong> that promote independence.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You&rsquo;ll explore this subject from multiple angles, starting with identifying and proposing your topic, then explaining it in depth, supporting real-world use, and finally communicating it clearly to the general public. This approach will allow you to develop professional-level skills in research, audience awareness, plain language writing, and visual communication. Further, by taking on a project that aims to serve, you&rsquo;ll be practicing the Virginia Tech motto: using your expertise not only for professional growth, but also to make a difference.</p>

                <p>By the end of the semester, you&rsquo;ll have created a complete portfolio of technical writing artifacts, all centered around one socially- relevant subject from your field. You&rsquo;ll have communicated that subject across a variety of professional genres, for multiple audiences, and in multiple formats. You&rsquo;ll gain experience not only in technical communication, but also in <strong>ethical, inclusive, and accessible writing</strong> that empowers people to understand and act.</p>
                <p>This project is about using your skills to <strong>do good work for good reasons.</strong> As you research and write, keep asking:<br /><strong></strong></p>
