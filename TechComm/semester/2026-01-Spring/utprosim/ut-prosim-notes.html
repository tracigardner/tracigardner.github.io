    <p>You get to choose the subject on which you will focus your work this semester. The caveat is that it must be a technical object, practice, or idea within your field that has the potential to create a positive social impact. In the spirit of <em>Ut Prosim</em>, your topic should be:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grounded in your major or area of study.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Clearly connected to community service, problem-solving, or public good.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Feasible to research and explain to multiple non-expert audiences.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Examples include the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessible design standards</strong> for public websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Water purification systems</strong> for underserved areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Renewable energy solutions</strong> for communities with limited resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Assistive technologies</strong> that promote independence.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You&rsquo;ll explore this subject from multiple angles, starting with identifying and proposing your topic, then explaining it in depth, supporting real-world use, and finally communicating it clearly to the general public. This approach will allow you to develop professional-level skills in research, audience awareness, plain language writing, and visual communication. Further, by taking on a project that aims to serve, you&rsquo;ll be practicing the Virginia Tech motto: using your expertise not only for professional growth, but also to make a difference.</p>


    <h2><strong>Project Focus: Writing that Makes a Difference</strong></h2>
    <p><em><strong>You</strong></em> get to choose the subject on which you will focus your work this semester.&nbsp; The caveat is that it must be a technical object, practice, or idea within your field that has the potential to create a positive social impact. It should be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grounded in your major or area of study</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Clearly connected to equity, access, or community benefit</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Feasible to research and explain to multiple non-expert audiences</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessible design standards</strong> for public websites</li>
        <li><strong>Water purification systems</strong> for under-served communities</li>
        <li><strong>Renewable energy solutions</strong> for energy-insecure neighborhoods</li>
        <li><strong>Assistive technologies</strong> that promote independence for people with disabilities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll explore this subject from multiple angles, starting with identifying and proposing your topic, then explaining it in depth, supporting real-world use, and finally communicating it clearly to the general public. This approach will allow you to develop professional-level skills in research, audience awareness, plain language writing, and visual communication.</p>

        <li>xxx</li>
        <li>Yxxx</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Over the course of this term, you will research, write, and design a series of interconnected documents about a subject rooted in your major that serves others and contributes to the greater good. Each assignment builds toward your ability to explain a complex topic clearly and accessibly to different real-world audiences, always with the goal of informing, guiding, or supporting action that contributes to fairness, accessibility, and the well-being of communities.</p>

    <p>Over the course of this term, you&rsquo;ll research, write, and design a series of interconnected documents about <strong>a socially-relevant subject connected to your major</strong>. Each assignment builds toward your ability to explain a complex topic clearly and accessibly to different real-world audiences &mdash; always with the goal of informing, guiding, or supporting action that contributes to equity, access, or social justice in communities. In other words, every major project you produce will be guided by the principle of <em>Ut Prosim </em>because it will serve the audience for whom you are writing it.</p>
