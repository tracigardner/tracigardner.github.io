    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In 1896, John McBryde &mdash; who was Virginia Tech's fifth president &mdash; assigned the motto that has come to identify the guiding principle of Virginia Tech: <em>Ut Prosim </em>(That I May Serve)<em>.&nbsp;</em>A <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2022/11/cm-service.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>2022 VT News article</strong></a> about the impact of this motto on Virginia Tech notes that while no one knows for certain why McBryde made this decision, his speeches "often reflected a desire for students to serve the interests of others." Today, this same article reports, this motto has been embraced by Hokies as a "timeless ideal of helping fellow humans and bettering the communities in which they live."</p>
    <p>In this course, you will come to see that technical writing puts that same <em>Ut Prosim</em> principle into everyday practice. At its best, technical writing is not just &ldquo;writing about technical stuff." Instead, it is writing that helps people <em data-start="292" data-end="297">use</em> information: to make decisions, follow a process, access services, stay safe, understand risks, or participate more fully in their workplaces and communities. Because technical documents often shape who can comply, who can benefit, and who gets left out, technical writers have an ethical responsibility to communicate in ways that reduce barriers rather than create them. Clear organization, plain language, thoughtful design, and audience awareness are all forms of service &mdash; especially when readers are busy, stressed, unfamiliar with the topic, or navigating systems that were not built with them in mind.</p>
    <p>Over the course of this term, you&rsquo;ll research, write, and design a series of interconnected documents about <strong>a socially-relevant subject connected to your major</strong>. Each assignment builds toward your ability to explain a complex topic clearly and accessibly to different real-world audiences &mdash; always with the goal of informing, guiding, or supporting action that contributes to equity, access, or social justice in communities. In other words, every major project you produce will be guided by the principle of <em>Ut Prosim </em>because it will serve the audience for whom you are writing it.</p>
    <p>This page explains the focus of the project and introduces each of the five major projects.</p>
    <h2><span style="color: #880000;"><strong>Project Focus: Writing that Makes a Difference</strong></span></h2>
    <p><em><strong>You</strong></em> get to choose the subject on which you will focus your work this semester.&nbsp; The caveat is that it must be a technical object, practice, or idea within your field that has the potential to create a positive social impact. It should be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grounded in your major or area of study</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Clearly connected to equity, access, or community benefit</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Feasible to research and explain to multiple non-expert audiences</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessible design standards</strong> for public websites</li>
        <li><strong>Water purification systems</strong> for under-served communities</li>
        <li><strong>Renewable energy solutions</strong> for energy-insecure neighborhoods</li>
        <li><strong>Assistive technologies</strong> that promote independence for people with disabilities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll explore this subject from multiple angles, starting with identifying and proposing your topic, then explaining it in depth, supporting real-world use, and finally communicating it clearly to the general public. This approach will allow you to develop professional-level skills in research, audience awareness, plain language writing, and visual communication.</p>
    <h2><span style="color: #880000;"><strong>How the Assignments Work Together</strong></span></h2>
    <p>Below is an overview of the six major assignments you&rsquo;ll complete this semester and a brief explanation of how each one contributes to the overall project.</p>

    <h2><span style="color: #880000;"><strong>Putting It All Together</strong></span></h2>
    <p>By the end of the semester, you&rsquo;ll have created a complete portfolio of technical writing artifacts, all centered around one socially- relevant subject from your field. You&rsquo;ll have communicated that subject across a variety of professional genres, for multiple audiences, and in multiple formats. You&rsquo;ll gain experience not only in technical communication, but also in <strong>ethical, inclusive, and accessible writing</strong> that empowers people to understand and act.</p>
    <p>This project is about using your skills to <strong>do good work for good reasons.</strong> As you research and write, keep asking:<br /><strong></strong></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Who benefits from this work? How can I help them understand and use it better?</strong></span></p>
    <p>Your audience &mdash; and your community &mdash; are counting on you.</p>
