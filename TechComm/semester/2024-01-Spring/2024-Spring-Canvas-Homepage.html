    <p>From a foundation based on the principles of rhetoric, you will learn to analyze writing situations, consider the needs of your audience, assemble evidence, and design final documents that are user-friendly and visually persuasive. By the time this course is over, you should be able to understand these documents and produce them with ease and confidence.</p>
