        <p style="padding-top: 18px;border-top: 1px solid #dedede;padding-bottom: 18px;border-bottom: 1px solid #dedede;">Find additional information about the course in the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2023-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall23.pdf" target="_blank">Short Guide to Technical Writing</a> and in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16wxl4vq3DuEZSx1Tzb9IwEsxvvElTCJnH50wjfw8l3U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Course Policy Manual</a>. These two accessible resources supplement this information.</p>

        <h3>Course Calendar</h3>
        <p>You can access the assignments for this course in three ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>at the bottom of the Syllabus page (this page)</li>
            <li>on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/assignments" target="_blank">Assignments page</a></li>
            <li>via the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/course-calendar-fall-2023" target="_blank">Course Calendar</a>, which lists dates for assignments and readings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first two sources do not provide links to readings for each assignment. You will find those only on the Course Calendar, so I encourage you to make it your go-to source.</p>

        <h3>Course Structure</h3>
        <p>This course consists of weekly modules. Each one of those modules may include additional resource modules that supplement textbook readings and serve as ready-references.</p>
        <p>Assignment links are found on the Course Calendar and at the bottom of the syllabus page.</p>

        <h3>Course Expectations</h3>
        <p>This course is 100% virtual; that is, we will never meet in the classroom. As a result, it is important that you understand how the course will be conducted and what will be expected of you as a student enrolled in it.</p>
        <p>As your teacher, it is my responsibility to (among other things)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Answer any questions you might have that are not covered by the textbook or another reading,</li>
            <li>Provide feedback to you about your work,</li>
            <li>Grade your work as promptly as possible,</li>
            <li>Use a grading rubric to help explain your grades,</li>
            <li>Update your grades on Canvas, and</li>
            <li>Inform you promptly of any alterations to the schedule, such as due date changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That said, in order to do well in this course, you must follow these policies:</p>
        <h4>Read All Announcements</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Announcements are the primary way I keep in touch with you, so it&rsquo;s imperative that you read every single one in its entirety. Not reading announcements will not be an excuse for not submitting work on time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Be Aware of Due Dates/Times</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Most (if not all) assignments are set to be due by 11:59 pm. You can, of course, upload your work earlier. All work should be uploaded in the appropriate manner to the appropriate page on the Canvas site.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Read All Materials and Review Examples</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Specific chapters were chosen from three different Open Educational Resource textbooks to give you the best possible introduction to the material. Our Canvas site also includes course-specific resource modules. Please ensure that you read all of this material before working on assignments.</li>
            <li>You will also find sample documents to most major assignment pages and some homework assignments. Review them. Pay attention to them. Many of them are real &ldquo;A&rdquo; level documents produced in this course.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Apply What You are Learning</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Do your best to apply what you have read and the lessons you have learned from reviewing examples to producing and improving your own work.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Follow Assignment Instructions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Each assignment provides you with a description of the deliverable and the specifications, including page length, formatting, and other requirements. Assignments other than discussions include checklists that are designed to help you cover all requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Conduct Yourself Professionally</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For this course, just as for one that meets in a classroom, you are expected to be civil to other participants and to the instructor, to apply what you are learning about professional correspondence to any messages or discussion posts, and to contribute conscientiously to any discussions and group assignments.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Course Policies</h3>
        <h4>Absences</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Granted, it is difficult to take roll in an online course that has no set meeting times. However, it is somewhat common to get overwhelmed, particularly if you are taking more than one online course. Sometimes, students even disappear (so to speak) from online classes. And that&rsquo;s truly what being absent means in a class that meets virtually: to go missing.</li>
            <li>Don&rsquo;t disappear and expect to make up missed work (daily work or major assignments). If you do disappear, expect that you will have to go to your dean (in person or via email) to provide me with an excuse before I will accept any missed work. If you cannot provide me with a legit excuse via your dean, the missed work will be entered as a zero (or zeroes).</li>
            <li>In the end, you will get the grade you get. If you decide to skip three major assignments and all homework, that&rsquo;s okay with me, as long as you realize you will not be permitted to make it up without documentation.</li>
            <li>If circumstances prevent participation or timely completion of assignments, you must contact me in advance of due dates.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Incompletes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>My department&rsquo;s policy states, &ldquo;Incompletes are for students who did their work during the semester but could not complete course requirements because of a problem or emergency at the end of the term.&rdquo; As a result, I cannot offer Incompletes for anyone who failed to keep up during the term. If you find you have an impossible amount of work to complete by the end of the term, withdrawing from the course is likely the best solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Participation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Participants in this course should expect to spend about 8&ndash;10 hours per week involved in the activities and completion of assignments over the semester. This is similar to the time one would invest in a course in a traditional classroom setting.</li>
            <li>This time invested is an average, with some weeks requiring more and some less time to complete all assignments and activities. Participation will be evaluated as the completion of all activities within the unit or module period.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Grading Policies</h3>

        <h4>Effort Expectations Contract</h4>
        <p>There is only one letter grade in this course: the course grade I enter for you at the end of the term. Your course grade is determined by comparing the amount of work you have earned a Complete on to the expectations shown in the table below, which serves as a contract for course grades.</p>
        <table class="topic" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 363px; padding: 6px;margin-bottom: 15px;" border="1">

        <h4>Additional Assessment Guidelines</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I do not average the percentages or make any other calculation with the numbers to determine your grade.</li>
            <li>The different categories listed on the Effort Expectations Contract are not equivalent. The Major Projects category is the most important category.</li>
            <li>You cannot pass the course without earning a Complete on at least Two Major Projects. If you have an F for the Major Projects category, you have an F as your course grade.</li>
            <li>To earn a Complete for the group projects, you must participate fully in the projects as well as submit documents that meet the basic criteria.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Feedback on Individual Assignments and Class Activities</h4>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <p>This course does not use letter or number grades on the work you submit. Research
                tells us grades are a terrible way to measure learning, so I don&rsquo;t use them. Your work in this course is marked Complete or Incomplete, based on whether the work meets the expectations for the assignment.</p>
            <p>If you want to learn more about grades and assessment, check out the work of <a href="https://www.jessestommel.com/how-to-ungrade/" target="_blank">Jesse Stommel</a>, <a href="https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/" target="_blank">Alfie Kohn</a>, and <a href="http://www.susanblum.com/blog/ungrading" target="_blank">Susan D. Blum</a>.</p>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Complete</h5>
            <p>I mark your work Complete in Canvas when it meets ALL of the following requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Submitted before the end of the Grace Period.</li>
                <li>Matches the assignment.</li>
                <li>Follows the <a href="http://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Honor System</a> and the <a href="https://www.inclusive.vt.edu/Programs/vtpoc0.html" target="_blank">Principles of Community</a>.</li>
                <li>Fulfills all of the criteria for the assignment (all criteria in the rubric are marked Yes).</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Incomplete</h5>
            <p>I mark your work Incomplete when it falls into ANY of the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Submitted after the end of the Grace Period.</li>
                <li>Is not finished.</li>
                Does not match the assignment.
                <li>Does not follow the <a href="http://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Honor System</a> and the <a href="https://www.inclusive.vt.edu/Programs/vtpoc0.html" target="_blank">Principles of Community</a>.</li>
                <li>Does not fulfill all of the criteria for the assignment (one or more criteria in the rubric is marked No).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your work earns an Incomplete, you can revise and resubmit as long as the Grace Period for the assignment is open.</p>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Complete and Incomplete Notation in Canvas</h5>
            <p>The Grades tool in Canvas keeps track of your work using a simple binary code:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete work is marked with a one (1) or a checkmark (✔) in Canvas.</li>
                <li>Incomplete work is marked with a zero (0) or an X mark (❌) in Canvas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This binary code does not bear any grade value. Your goal is to earn a Complete on as much work as you need to reach your goal for the course.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Submission Guidelines</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Unless otherwise noted, all work for the course is completed in Canvas. You will submit your work on the specific assignment page. That page will identify what you need to write or the type of file to be uploaded (.doc, .docx, .pdf).</li>
            <li>Suggested naming convention for all assignments: YourLastName_Assignment_Date or YourLastName-Assignment-Date. (EX: Smith_UserManual_F22).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Late Assignments</h4>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <p>
                I accept late work for most of the assignments in this course, using a Grace Period system. You don&rsquo;t need to ask in advance or explain why your work is late. Just take more time when you need it, as many times as you need it. Turn your work in when you can before the grace period ends.
            </p>
            <p>For additional details, see the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2023-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall23.pdf#page=5" target="_blank">Short Guide</a>.</p>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Details on the Grace Period</h5>
            <p>The grace period covers most situations, whether a religious holiday, academic conflict, illness, or a personal issue. If you cannot meet a due date, use the grace period. The grace period occurs between the target due date and the last moment that you can submit work in the course.</p>
            <p>Canvas indicates the end of the grace period as the “available until” date. If you turn in your work during the Grace Period, Canvas will mark the activity as Late. Don&lsquo;t worry about this late label. There is no grade penalty for work submitted during the grace period.</p>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>We affirm the inherent dignity and value of every person and strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual respect and understanding.</li>
            <li>We affirm the right of each person to express thoughts and opinions freely.</li>
            <li>We encourage open expression within a climate of civility, sensitivity, and mutual respect.</li>
            <li>We affirm the value of human diversity because it enriches our lives and the University. We acknowledge and respect our differences while affirming our common humanity.</li>
            <li>We reject all forms of prejudice and discrimination, including those based on age, color, disability, gender, national origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, and veteran status. We take individual and collective responsibility for helping to eliminate bias and discrimination and for increasing our own understanding of these issues through education, training, and interaction with others.</li>
            <li>We pledge our collective commitment to these principles in the spirit of the Virginia Tech motto of <em>Ut Prosim</em> (That I May Serve).</li>

            <blockquote>&ldquo;As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.&rdquo;</blockquote>
            <p>Students enrolled in this course are responsible for working according to the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation.</p>
            <p>Students are strongly discouraged from misusing sites such as Chegg and CourseHero, as well as misusing ChatGPT and other Generative Artificial Intelligence. Students are strongly encouraged to consult their faculty members regarding the use of such outside materials as the misuse of these sources may constitute a violation of the Honor Code. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code.</p>
            <p>Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code. Academic integrity expectations are the same for online classes as they are for in person classes.

If not possible, send the information as soon as you can. Because I am not on campus due to COVID-19, do not take your documentation to my office.</p>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 0px;">What if I do not have official documentation?</h5>
            <p>That&rsquo;s okay too. I know that the official testing can be expensive and time-consuming. Send me <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10573-4212710324" target="_blank">a private message in Canvas</a> that tells me what you need, and I will try to help.</p>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 0px;">I need extra time on projects.</h5>
            <p>No problem. If you need more time on a project or need to complete work in a less distracting environment, take the time you need. Check <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-MeXdKL8mGtBq6HXArIoH_iWfVrOyyR4m-JMLsYVOFw/edit#heading=h.sh3i164rz29" target="_blank">the late policy</a> in the Course Policy Manual for more details.</p>
