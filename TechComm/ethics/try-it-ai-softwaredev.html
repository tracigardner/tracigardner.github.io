            <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Grace Period Reminder</h3>
            <p>Try-Its have a three-day grace period. The grace period for this Try-It ends at 11:59 PM on Wednesday, [TBD].</p>

            <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">What You Need to Do</h3>
            <p>Consider the social impact of developing software documentation with generative AI. </p>

            <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">How This Activity Connects to the Course</h3>
            <p>The ethical principles you will follow in this course connect directly to all of the group tasks that you will complete in this course. In this instance, you and your group will decide later the extent to which you&rsquo;ll use AI in your Recommendation Report.</p>

            <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Read the scenario below and consider the ethical dilemma involved.</li>
                <li>Respond to the scenario in <strong>your first post</strong> explaining what you would do in Javier&rsquo;s situation.</li>
                <li>Read the posts from others in your group, paying attention to how you agree or disagree on the solution.</li>
                <li>Interact with your group in <strong>additional posts</strong> to discuss the solution your group would recommend and the actions Javier should take to avoid such dilemmas in the future.</li>
                <li><strong>Post a clear statement</strong> of your group&rsquo;s recommendation at the end of this Discussion.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">The Scenario</h3>
            <div style="margin: 18px 40px;padding: 12px;border: 1px solid #861f41;background-color: #f9f9f9">
                <h3 style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>Generative AI &amp; Software Development</strong></h3>
                <p><img style="float: right;width:300px;height: 234px;" src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/noun-documentation-6834383-861F41-edited.png" alt="">Javier is a senior technical writer at CodeCraft, a software development company known for its innovative products and cutting-edge technology. Recently, CodeCraft integrated a generative AI tool called DocuGen into its documentation process. DocuGen uses natural language processing and machine learning to create comprehensive software documentation, including user manuals, API guides, and troubleshooting instructions.</p>

                <p>Javier and his team have been using DocuGen for a few months, and it has dramatically increased their productivity. The AI tool can produce initial drafts of documentation much faster than human writers, allowing the team to focus on refining and adding nuanced details. However, Javier has noticed several issues with the AI-generated documentation:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The AI sometimes includes outdated or incorrect information, which requires careful review and correction.</li>
                    <li>AI-generated documentation will cause the loss of the team's unique writing style.</li>
                    <li>Shifting to AI may may result in a decline in the overall quality and clarity of the documentation.</li>
                    <li>As the reliance on AI increases, team members&rsquo; worries about their job security will likely increase.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>One day, during a project review meeting, the product manager proposes that the company fully transition to using DocuGen for all documentation needs, citing cost savings and increased efficiency. Javier is asked to provide his input on the proposal. Javier faces a complex decision that involves evaluating the benefits of AI-driven documentation against potential ethical and practical challenges. The discussion should explore the implications of using generative AI in technical communication, highlighting the need for a thoughtful approach that ensures accuracy, quality, and ethical responsibility.</p>

                <h4>Questions to Consider</h4>
                <p>As you decide what Javier should do, consider the following issues:</p>
                <ol class="skipline">
                    <li><strong>Accuracy and Reliability:</strong> How should CodeCraft address the inaccuracies and outdated information in the AI-generated documentation? What processes should be in place to ensure the reliability of the documentation?</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality and Style:</strong> How important is the human touch in technical documentation? Can generative AI tools match the quality and style of experienced human writers? Should there be a balance between AI and human-written content?</li>
                    <li><strong>Employment and Skills:</strong> What are the ethical implications of potentially reducing the need for human technical writers? How can CodeCraft ensure that its employees' skills are still valued and developed in an AI-integrated environment?</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency and User Trust:</strong> Should CodeCraft inform its users that their documentation is generated by AI? How might this affect user trust and the company's reputation?</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethical Use of AI:</strong> What ethical considerations should be taken into account when deciding to use generative AI for documentation? How can CodeCraft balance the benefits of AI with the ethical responsibility to its employees and customers?</li>
                </ol>
