    <p>As you are learning, every profession&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s engineering, health care, education, the sciences, or business&mdash;has its own set of rules about what&rsquo;s right and wrong. These rules, often written into a <strong>code of ethics</strong>, help guide professionals as they make decisions, work with others, and take responsibility for their actions. Following ethical principles builds trust, protects people from harm, and ensures that professionals act with honesty, fairness, and care. Ethics also helps professionals navigate tricky situations where there may be more than one &ldquo;right&rdquo; answer or where personal and professional values might conflict.</p>
    <p>Ethics involves working in ways that support <strong>equity and social justice</strong>. When professionals pay attention to how their actions affect different communities, especially those who are vulnerable or historically excluded, they help make systems more fair and inclusive. In this discussion, you&rsquo;ll look up and share the code of ethics for your intended career. You&rsquo;ll reflect on what it says, what stands out to you, and how it might shape your work in the future. This is your chance to see how your profession defines responsibility and how you can become a trusted and ethical member of that field.<strong></strong></p>
    <h2><span style="color: #861f41;"><strong>Assignment Objectives</strong></span></h2>
    <p>This exercise is designed to help you develop ethical awareness and communication skills by asking you to</p>
    <ul>
        <li>locate and interpret a professional code of ethics relevant to your intended career field,</li>
        <li>critically analyze how that code reflects broader ethical principles discussed in the course, and</li>
        <li>engage with your peers to compare ethical standards across disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary understanding and respectful, professional dialogue.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><span style="color: #861f41;"><strong>Assignment Specifications</strong></span></h2>
    <p>Find the code of ethics that represents your intended profession. Most disciplines will have several. For example, a quick Google search for &ldquo;Code of ethics for engineers&rdquo; presented over 3 million hits. This fact means you might get a more precise list if you narrow your search&mdash;instead of engineering, try electrical engineering or chemical engineering.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><strong>Part 1: Your First Post</strong></h3>
    <p>Please do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Find the code of ethics for your profession.</li>
        <li>Read it.</li>
        <li>Respond with the following information, in about 150-200 words:
            <ul>
                <li>briefly summarize the code,</li>
                <li>provide a link to it, and</li>
                <li>consider the following questions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Did you already have familiarity with code, either through reading it on your own or being taught about it by professors in your major?</li>
                        <li>What struck you as important or noteworthy about this code?</li>
                        <li>What is one point from your code that aligns with what you read about in our ethics chapter?</li>
                        <li>Have you ever seen this code in practice&mdash;for example in an internship or co-op or summer employment?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Canvas is set so that you must post your response before seeing the response of others.</p>
    <h3><strong>Part 2: Your Two Replies</strong></h3>
    <p>Respond to the posts of <strong>TWO</strong> of your classmates by answering <strong>ONE</strong> of the following questions about each (you can select different questions to answer for your two responses):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Did anything in their response make you think differently about your own profession's code of ethics? If so, how?</li>
        <li>What connections can you draw between their professional code and your own? Are there shared values or priorities?</li>
        <li>Do you think their profession faces ethical challenges that are different from yours? Explain your reasoning.</li>
        <li>Was there a part of their code or interpretation that surprised you or that you found especially important? Why?</li>
        <li>Based on their post, how might this code influence the decisions or actions someone takes in that field?</li>
    </ul>
