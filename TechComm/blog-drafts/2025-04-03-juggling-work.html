You&rsquo;re not imagining it; it really is a lot. But small pacing strategies can help you manage the load without burning out before finals week.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #861f41;clear: none;">1. Break the Week into Zones</h2>
    <p>Instead of trying to do everything every day, try assigning themes to different days or blocks of time. For example:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1.2em;">
        <li><strong>Monday/Wednesday:</strong> Focus on job shifts + short tasks like discussion posts or emails</li>
        <li><strong>Tuesday/Thursday:</strong> Course-heavy days for longer assignments or research</li>
        <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> Light planning, calendar updates, and catching up</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This helps you stay in one kind of mental mode at a time—and lowers the pressure to “do it all” every day.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #861f41;">2. Use the 45/15 Rule for Long Tasks</h2>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re working on a paper, coding assignment, or report, set a timer: 45 minutes on, 15 minutes off. During the break, walk around, change tasks, or check in with life stuff (dishes, laundry, texts). This pacing helps you stay productive without zoning out or overworking.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #861f41;">3. Anchor Each Week with a 10-Minute Check-In</h2>
    <p>On Sunday night or Monday morning, look at the week ahead. Ask:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1.2em;">
        <li>What are my non-negotiables this week (work shifts, appointments, big deadlines)?</li>
        <li>Where are my open blocks&mdash;and what can I realistically do in them?</li>
        <li>What can I let go of or pause this week?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This kind of reset helps you stay proactive, not reactive.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #861f41;">4. Protect a No-School Zone</h2>
    <p>Even one evening or afternoon a week without schoolwork can make a difference. Protect that time like you would a shift or a class. Use it to rest, see people, or just be off duty for a bit—it helps reset your focus when you return to work or school mode.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #861f41;">Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;do it all&rdquo; at once. A little structure helps you do what matters most without draining your energy. Start small, adjust as you go, and build a rhythm that works for you.</p>
