    <h2 style="color: #861f41;">How to Check Your Progress in This Course</h2>

    <p><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/blog-drafts/images/woman-checking-grades.png" alt="A photo of a black woman college student working on a laptop" style="width: 300px;height: 300px;float:right;margin: 0px 0px 24px 15px;border-radius: 6px;">Canvas calculates your grades based only on the work you&rsquo;ve submitted so far. That means it ignores anything not yet turned in&mdash;even if it&rsquo;s overdue. As a result, the summary at the bottom of the Grades page might show an overly optimistic estimate of your course grade.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #861f41;">Why I&rsquo;m Marking Remaining Work as Incomplete</h3>

    <p>To give you a more realistic view of your current standing,<span style="background-color: #f7ea48;">&nbsp;I will mark all remaining work in the course as <strong>Incomplete</strong> in Canvas during the weekend.&nbsp;</span> This doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve failed those assignments&mdash;it just allows Canvas to factor in what&rsquo;s still missing when it calculates your overall progress.</p>

    <p>This adjustment makes the <strong>category percentages and summary at the bottom of your Grades page</strong> more accurate, so you can see your estimated course grade based on everything expected of you&mdash;not just what you&rsquo;ve already submitted.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #861f41;">Releasing Your Current Grade Estimate</h3>

    <p>I will calculate your current course grade by the middle of next week. I plan to add feedback on the work that meets the Target Due Date of April 18 before calculating the estimates.</p>

    <p>This estimate will tell you where you stand as of the moment it is released. That estimate is locked in. If you stop working in the course, it will be your course grade.</p>


    <h3 style="color: #861f41;">How to Check Your Current Grade</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Go to the Grades page in Canvas.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Scroll to the bottom</strong> to see a breakdown like this:
            <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; margin: 1em 0;">
                <caption style="text-align: left;caption-side: bottom;font-style:italic;">Table: Example Grade Summary Breakdown</caption>

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Compare your percentages</strong> to the Effort Expectations Contract:

            <ul>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: 5 Major Projects, 95% Surveys, 95% Activities</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: 4 Major Projects, 85% Surveys, 85% Activities</li>
                <li><strong>C</strong>: 3 Major Projects, 75% Surveys, 75% Activities</li>
                <li><strong>D</strong>: 2 Major Projects, 65% Surveys, 65% Activities</li>
                <li><strong>F</strong>: Less than 2 Projects, below 65% in other categories</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <ol start="4">
        <li><strong>Figure out your estimated course grade</strong> based on where your percentages line up. Remember:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Major Projects carry the most weight. Start there for your base grade.</strong></li>
                <li>You must earn a Complete on at least <strong>2 Major Projects</strong> to pass the course.</li>
                <li>Grades are <strong>not averaged</strong>; they are based on meeting the specific expectations in each category.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 style="color: #861f41;">Example Course Grade Calculation</h3>
    <p>The student whose example numbers are in the table in the previous section has a B- course grade estimate. Here&rsquo;s how I arrived at that grade:</p>
    <ol>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The student has 4 of 5 Major Projects, so that&rsquo;s a B as the base.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The student has 85% of the Check-In Surveys, so that&rsquo;s another B. The estimate stays as a B.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The student has 75% of the Weekly Activities, so that&rsquo;s a C.
            <ul>
                <li>As it stands, the student has missed 27 of the 36 activities (so 9 total).</li>
                <li>That&rsquo;s a lot. Not just a couple. Not just a bad day or a bad week.</li>
                <li>It&rsquo;s only one grade level lower than the rest of the estimate, so a half-step deduction makes sense.</li>
                <li>The grade estimate moves down to a B-.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">I check my logs for both the student&rsquo;s individual work and group work. I ask myself these questions:
            <ul>
                <li>Did the student participate in the Group work consistently?</li>
                <li>Did the student miss any Group work?</li>
                <li>Did the student have any extenuating experiences (e.g., medical issue, family emergency) this term? </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Should any of these answers impact the student&rsquo;s course grade?</li>
            </ul>
            In this particular example, the student doesn&rsquo;t exist, so there are no notes to impact the grade. It stands as a B- at this point in the course.
        </li>
    </ol>
