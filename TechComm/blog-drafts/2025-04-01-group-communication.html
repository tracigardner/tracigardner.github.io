    <h1 style="color: #861f41;">What to Do When Your Group Isn’t Communicating</h1>

    <p>Working on a big assignment like the Recommendation Report means relying on others. But what do you do when your group chat is quiet, tasks are unclear, or you’re the only one showing up? Here are a few low-stress moves you can make right now to keep the project moving—and protect your time and effort.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">1. Reset the Conversation</h2>
    <p>Sometimes people don’t reply because they’re not sure what to say or what’s expected. Instead of asking open-ended questions like “What should we do next?”, try something specific:
        <br><em>“I’m working on the secondary research section this week. Could one of you take the lead on drafting the intro or outlining the alternatives section?”</em>
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">2. Set a Micro-Deadline</h2>
    <p>If the group isn’t moving, propose a short, no-pressure task with a clear due time. For example:
        <br><em>“Let’s each drop 2–3 sources in the shared doc by Thursday evening. I’ll check in Friday to see where we are.”</em>
        <br>This can help others re-engage without needing a full group meeting.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">3. Use the Tools to Create Accountability</h2>
    <p>Even if your group isn’t talking much, a shared Google Doc or spreadsheet gives you a place to track progress. Use headings like <strong>Task</strong>, <strong>Assigned To</strong>, and <strong>Status</strong>. Sometimes just seeing names next to responsibilities gets people to act.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">4. If You're Doing the Work, Keep Track</h2>
    <p>If you’re carrying more than your share right now, start documenting what you’ve done. You don’t need to narrate it—just keep notes in your doc or messages like,
        <br><em>“I added a draft of the introduction—feel free to revise or build on it.”</em>
        <br>This gives you a record of your effort and shows professionalism.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">5. Know When to Loop in Your Instructor</h2>
    <p>If you’ve reached out clearly and consistently, and someone isn’t responding at all, it’s okay to let your instructor know—especially if it’s slowing down your group. Keep it factual:
        <br><em>“We’ve tried contacting [name] several times with no response. We just want to let you know where we are so we can plan around it.”</em>
    </p>

    <p style="background-color: #f0e6e9; border-left: 4px solid #861f41; padding: 1em; margin-top: 2em;"><strong>Reminder:</strong> Group work is rarely perfect. Keep your tone calm, your goals clear, and your own work documented. That’s not just good teamwork—it’s solid project management.</p>
