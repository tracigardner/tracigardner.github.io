    <h1 style="color: #861f41;">What to Do When Your Group Isn&rsquo;t Communicating</h1>

    <p><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/blog-drafts/images/wheelchair-woman-working.png" alt="A photo of a college student in a wheelchair, working on her laptop" style="width: 300px;height: 300px;float:right;margin: 0px 0px 24px 15px;border-radius: 6px;transform: rotateY(180deg);">Working on a big assignment like the Recommendation Report means relying on others. But what do you do when your group chat is quiet, tasks are unclear, or you&rsquo;re the only one showing up? Here are a few low-stress moves you can make right now to keep the project moving and protect your time and effort.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;clear: none;">1. Reset the Conversation</h2>
    <p>Sometimes people don&rsquo;t reply because they&rsquo;re not sure what to say or what&rsquo;s expected. Instead of asking open-ended questions like &ldquo;What should we do next?&rdquo;, try something specific: <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on the secondary research section this week. Could one of you take the lead on drafting the intro or outlining the methods section?&rdquo;</em>
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">2. Set Micro-Deadlines</h2>
    <p>If the group isn&rsquo;t moving, propose a short, no-pressure task with a clear due time. For example: <em>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s each drop 2&ndash;3 sources in the shared doc by Thursday evening. I&rsquo;ll check in Friday to see where we are.&rdquo;</em> This strategy can help others re-engage without needing a full group meeting.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">3. Use Announcements to Create Accountability</h2>
    <p>Even if your group isn&rsquo;t talking much, an Group Announcement in Canvas gives you a place to track progress. Use headings like <strong>Task</strong>, <strong>Assigned To</strong>, and <strong>Status</strong>. Sometimes just seeing names next to responsibilities gets people to act. Ask group members to reply with updates.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">4. If You&rsquo;re Doing the Work, Keep Track</h2>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re carrying more than your share right now, start documenting what you&rsquo;ve done. You don&rsquo;t need to narrate it&mdash;just keep notes in your doc or messages like, <em>&ldquo;I added a draft of the introduction&mdash;feel free to revise or build on it.&rdquo;</em> These comments give you a record of your effort and shows professionalism.
    </p>

    <p style="background-color: #f0e6e9; border-left: 4px solid #861f41; padding: 1em; margin-top: 2em;"><strong>Reminder:</strong> Group work is rarely perfect. Keep your tone calm, your goals clear, and your own work documented. That&rsquo;s not just good teamwork&mdash;it&rsquo;s solid project management.</p>
