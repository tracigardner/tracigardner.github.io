        <h2 style="color: #861f41;">Colors and Cultures: Why Color Choices Matter</h2>

        <p><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/blog-drafts/images/college-students-football.png" alt="College students cheer and exclaim at a football game" style="width: 300px;height: 300px;float:right;margin: 0px 0px 24px 15px;border-radius: 6px;">When creating professional documents, presentations, or graphics, it&rsquo;s important to think not just about how colors look&mdash;but also what they <em>mean</em> to different audiences.

        <p>When using multiple colors together, it&rsquo;s helpful to ask: <em>Could this color scheme already mean something important to my audience?</em></p>

        <h3 style="color: #861f41;">Tips for Choosing Colors Thoughtfully</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Think about your audience. If you&rsquo;re writing for an international or multicultural group, choose colors with broad, positive associations.</li>
