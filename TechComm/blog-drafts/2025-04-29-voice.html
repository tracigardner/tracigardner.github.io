        <h2 style="color: #861f41;">Grammatical Voice in Scientific Writing</h2>
        <p>In scientific and technical communication, the <strong>voice</strong> you choose affects how readers perceive your work. Although we typically focus on <em>active</em> and <em>passive</em> voice, this week we are having a little fun exploring additional &ldquo;voices&rdquo; too!</p>

        <p>Take a look at this comic by Tom Gauld for <em>New Scientist</em>:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="/TechComm/-images/voice.jpg" alt="Comic illustrating grammatical voices for scientific writing" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 2px solid #861f41; padding: 5px; border-radius: 8px;">
        </p>

        <p>Notice the differences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Active Voice</strong>: Clear and direct (&ldquo;Our team collected samples.&rdquo;)</li>
            <li><strong>Passive Voice</strong>: Objective and often used for formal reporting (&ldquo;Samples were collected.&rdquo;)</li>
            <li><strong>Passive-Aggressive Voice</strong>: Adds unintended tone (&ldquo;No need to thank us.&rdquo;)</li>
            <li><strong>Clickbait Voice</strong>: Creates suspense (&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t believe what happened next!&rdquo;)</li>
            <li><strong>Haiku Voice</strong>: Minimalist and poetic (&ldquo;Quiet science lab.&rdquo;)</li>
            <li><strong>Conspiracy Voice</strong>: Casts doubt (&ldquo;Mysterious &lsquo;samples&rsquo; were harvested.&rdquo;)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For your writing this week, focus on using <strong>active voice</strong> unless you have a clear reason to choose otherwise. Active voice usually makes technical documents stronger, clearer, and more engaging for your audience.</p>

        <p><strong>Mini-Challenge:</strong> Try rewriting one of your own sentences in <em>each</em> of the six voices above&mdash;just for fun!</p>
