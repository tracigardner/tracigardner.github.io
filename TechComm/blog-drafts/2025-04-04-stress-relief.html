    <h1 style="color: #861f41;">Quick Ways to Reset &amp; Relieve Stress</h1>

    <p><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/blog-drafts/images/therapy-poodle.png" alt="A photo of a black college student sitting outside on campus with a poodle therapy dog" style="width: 300px;height: 300px;float:right;margin: 0px 0px 24px 15px;border-radius: 6px;">College life comes with a constant balancing act&mdash;deadlines, group work, jobs, and everything else you&rsquo;re trying to do. If you&rsquo;re feeling overloaded, you&rsquo;re not alone. Virginia Tech offers plenty of simple, low-stress ways to get back on track, no appointment required.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #861f41;clear: none;">Try Quick Stress Relief</h2>
    <p>If you&rsquo;ve got five minutes between classes or before a team meeting, you can still reset. The <a href="https://ucc.vt.edu/self_help_support_stategies/Relieve_Stress_Now.html" target="_blank">Cook Counseling Center&rsquo;s Relieve Stress Now</a> page has quick strategies that actually work, from breathing exercises to muscle relaxation techniques. You don&rsquo;t need gear, apps, or a quiet room. Just pick one and try it out.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #861f41;">Hang Out with Therapy Dogs</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, the best relief is a tail wag and a nuzzle. The <a href="https://ucc.vt.edu/vt-therapy-dogs.html" target="_blank">Virginia Tech Therapy Dogs</a> program brings trained dogs (and their friendly handlers) to campus spaces for drop-in comfort. If you haven&rsquo;t met them yet, it&rsquo;s worth stopping by.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #861f41;">Meet Growley III, the Corps of Cadets' Comfort Dog</h2>
    <p><a href="https://vtcc.vt.edu/about/growley.html" target="_blank">Growley III</a> is not just a beloved member of the Corps. He&rsquo;s also an unofficial ambassador. You&rsquo;ll often see him around campus events and outreach efforts. Follow him on Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/vtgrowley/" target="_blank">@vtgrowley</a>).</p>

    <h2 style="color: #861f41;">Tap into Campus Well-Being Resources</h2>

You can find everything from mental health tools to counseling options and workshops on managing stress and building resilience. All tailored to student life, and many services are free.</p>

    <p><strong>One Last Thought:</strong> Stress is normal. What matters is building small, repeatable ways to handle it. Use the resources that work for you, and share them with friends who might need them too.</p>
