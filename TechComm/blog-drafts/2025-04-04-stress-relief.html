    <h1 style="color: #861f41;">Quick Ways to Reset: Stress Relief for College Life</h1>

    <p>College life comes with a constant balancing act—deadlines, group work, jobs, and everything else you’re juggling. If you’re feeling overloaded, you’re not alone—and you’re not stuck. Virginia Tech offers plenty of simple, low-stress ways to get back on track, no appointment required.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">1. Try a Fast-Acting Stress Strategy</h2>
    <p>If you’ve got five minutes between classes or before a team meeting, you can still reset. The <a href="https://ucc.vt.edu/self_help_support_stategies/Relieve_Stress_Now.html" style="color: #861f41; text-decoration: none;">UCC’s Relieve Stress Now</a> page has quick strategies that actually work—from breathing exercises to muscle relaxation techniques. You don’t need gear, apps, or a quiet room. Just pick one and try it out.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">2. Hang Out with Therapy Dogs</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, the best relief is a tail wag and a nuzzle. The <a href="https://ucc.vt.edu/vt-therapy-dogs.html" style="color: #861f41; text-decoration: none;">Virginia Tech Therapy Dogs</a> program brings trained dogs (and their friendly handlers) to campus spaces for drop-in comfort. If you haven’t met them yet, it’s worth stopping by—you’ll walk away smiling.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">3. Meet Growley II, the Corps of Cadets' Comfort Dog</h2>
    <p><a href="https://vtcc.vt.edu/about/growley.html" style="color: #861f41; text-decoration: none;">Growley II</a> is not just a beloved member of the Corps—he’s also an unofficial ambassador of calm. You’ll often see him around campus events and outreach efforts. Keep an eye out: getting a high-five from Growley might be the best moment of your week.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">4. Tap into Campus Well-Being Resources</h2>
    <p>For deeper support or longer-term wellness strategies, the <a href="https://well-being.vt.edu/mental.html" style="color: #861f41; text-decoration: none;">Virginia Tech Well-Being Hub</a> has what you need—from mental health tools to counseling options to workshops on managing stress and building resilience. Everything is tailored to student life, and many services are free.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #f0e6e9; border-left: 4px solid #861f41; padding: 1em; margin-top: 2em;"><strong>Reminder:</strong> Stress is normal. What matters is building small, repeatable ways to handle it. Use the resources that work for you—and share them with friends who might need them too.</p>
