        <p><img src="images/student-email-dorm.png" alt="Student writing on their laptop in a dorm room" style="width: 300px;height: 300px;float:right;margin: 0px 0px 24px 15px;border-radius: 6px;">Email is still the backbone of professional communication, but inboxes are crowded and attention spans are short. If you want your message to stand out (in a good way), you need to think about more than just grammar and spelling&mdash;you need a strategy.</p>

        <p style="clear:none;">Effective emails are not long lectures or confusing puzzles. They&rsquo;re quick to understand, easy to navigate, and respectful of the reader&rsquo;s time.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #861f41;">Key Principles for Smarter Email Writing</h3>

        <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Start strong:</strong> Your subject line should tell the reader what they will get by opening the email. Be clear, not clever.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Think mobile-first:</strong> Most emails today are read on a phone. If your main point doesn&rsquo;t fit in the first few lines, many people won&rsquo;t scroll down to find it.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Front-load important information:</strong> Don&rsquo;t bury key details deep in the email. Assume your reader might skim, not study.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Use visual structure:</strong> Break up long text into short sections, bullets, or bolded headings. Make it easy to scan and digest.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Include a clear action:</strong> If you need something, say exactly what and when. Avoid vague requests like &ldquo;let me know what you think&rdquo; unless that truly is your goal.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Be human, but professional:</strong> Use a friendly tone when appropriate, but skip the filler ("I hope this email finds you well!") unless it really fits the situation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: #861f41;">Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h3>

        <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Paragraph walls:</strong> Dense blocks of text make people want to click away.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Mystery subject lines:</strong> If the reader can&rsquo;t tell what the email is about from the subject line, they might not open it.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Unclear requests:</strong> Readers should never have to guess what you need from them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: #861f41;">Why This Matters</h3>

        <p>Writing better emails isn&rsquo;t just about being polite. It&rsquo;s about showing that you respect the reader&rsquo;s time and understand how professional communication works. Strong email habits can build trust, strengthen teamwork, and even open doors to future opportunities.</p>

        <p>For a quick reference, here&rsquo;s a visual overview. But remember&mdash;good email writing is a habit you build, not just a checklist you follow!</p>

                <h3 style="color: #861f41;">Email That Works</h3>
                <p><strong>Email is a noisy environment. Stand out. Be brief, bold, and clear. Think outside the paragraph.</strong></p>

                <h4 style="color: #861f41;">Tips for Effective Email</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Revealing subject line:</strong> Tell readers what to expect. Also becomes an accurate heading for reply threads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Microwave greeting:</strong> If you must introduce yourself, do it simply and quickly to warm things up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;you&rdquo;:</strong> Use pronouns to be direct and involve the reader.</li>
                    <li><strong>Summary sentences:</strong> Use the first 20 words to tell readers what to expect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skimmable headings and bullets:</strong> Avoid long paragraphs. Use formatting features to aid skimming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Links:</strong> Let readers click to review detailed material rather than overloading the email with information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Use photos or charts to clarify or support your content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call to action:</strong> Be clear about what you want the reader to do next.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deadline:</strong> Let readers know how much time they have to respond or act.</li>
                    <li><strong>250-word limit:</strong> Be brief for maximum effectiveness, especially on a phone screen.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 style="color: #861f41;">Sample Email Example</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>From:</strong> Michonne Z. Slayer, VP of HR<br>
                    <strong>To:</strong> All staff<br>
                    <strong>Re:</strong> A few steps to prepare for the zombie apocalypse
                </p>

                <p>The company has launched its zombie apocalypse preparedness plan (ZAPP).</p>

                <p>As your HR leader, I&rsquo;ve prepared this email to explain what actions you should take.</p>

                <h4>Why now?</h4>
                <p>After the well-publicized zombie takeover in Fayetteville, Georgia, the CEO and I created this preparedness plan to ensure that our employees will be safe and productive in the event of zombie attacks.</p>

                <h4>Learn about the zombie threat</h4>
                <p>If zombies make you nervous, it&rsquo;s completely understandable. To be properly prepared, review the materials below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">CDC&rsquo;s zombie apocalypse web site</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">ZAPP directory on our corporate intranet</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">ZAPP group on our internal social network</a> (for updates)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>What you should do</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>We&rsquo;re seeking volunteers in each office to sign up as ZAPP captains and take our short online training course. See your local HR leader by the end of this month.</li>
                    <li>In the event of an attack, find the volunteers in your office &mdash; they&rsquo;ll have red ZAPP caps at their desks.</li>
                    <li>One break room in each office now has a ZAPP kit, including fresh water, tools, first-aid supplies, and crossbows. Learn the location of the ZAPP kit in your office.</li>
                    <li>Please be aware that our health plan does not cover zombieism, and that bereavement policies do not apply to the undead.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I know it&rsquo;s a busy time of year, but please review these resources and policies this week and, if you&rsquo;re so inclined, volunteer to help. Let&rsquo;s support each other and stay safe.</p>
