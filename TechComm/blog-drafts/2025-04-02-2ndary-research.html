    <h1 style="color: #861f41;">Secondary Research That Stands Out</h1>

    <p>We often treat secondary research like a box to check. Find five sources, cite them, move on. But if you treat it like a scavenger hunt instead of a chore, you&rsquo;ll discover sources that do more than fill space. They can <strong>shape your thinking</strong>.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #e5751f;">1. Chase Down the &ldquo;Cited By&rdquo; Trail</h3>
    <p>Found a great article? Don&rsquo;t stop there. Use <a href="https://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cited By&rdquo; feature to see who else has built on that work. Newer sources might offer updated statistics or contrasting perspectives.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #e5751f;">2. Explore Trade Publications and Industry News</h3>
    <p>Not every credible source lives in a peer-reviewed journal. Depending on your topic, trade magazines and industry blogs can offer current insights, professional opinions, and emerging trends. Bonus: they often explain things in accessible language. The Virginia Tech Library has resources on <a href="https://guides.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/business-info" target="_blank">Business, Company, and Industry Information</a>. You can also consult <a href="https://guides.lib.vt.edu/regional-business-news" target="_blank">Regional Business News from EBSCOhost</a>.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #e5751f;">3. Search Strategically</h3>
    <p>Swap out basic keywords for more specific or technical ones that professionals in the field might use. Instead of &ldquo;workplace communication,&rdquo; try &ldquo;knowledge transfer in distributed teams&rdquo; or &ldquo;cross-functional collaboration.&rdquo; This switch can open up a whole new set of sources.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #f0e6e9; border-left: 4px solid #861f41; padding: 1em; margin-top: 2em;"><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for gaps. What <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> being said in the sources you find? Noticing what&rsquo;s missing can help you frame your report&rsquo;s contribution more sharply.</p>
