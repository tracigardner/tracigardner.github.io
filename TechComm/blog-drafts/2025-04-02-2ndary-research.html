    <h1 style="color: #861f41;">Secondary Research That Stands Out</h1>

    <p>We often treat secondary research like a box to check—find five sources, cite them, move on. But if you treat it like a scavenger hunt instead of a chore, you’ll discover sources that do more than fill space. They can <strong>shape your thinking</strong>.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">1. Chase Down the “Cited By” Trail</h2>
    <p>Found a great article? Don’t stop there. Use Google Scholar’s “Cited By” feature to see who else has built on that work. Newer sources might offer updated statistics or contrasting perspectives.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">2. Explore Trade Publications and Industry News</h2>
    <p>Not every credible source lives in a peer-reviewed journal. Depending on your topic, trade magazines and industry blogs can offer current insights, professional opinions, and emerging trends. Bonus: they often explain things in accessible language.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">3. Search Strategically</h2>
    <p>Swap out basic keywords for more specific or technical ones that professionals in the field might use. Instead of “workplace communication,” try “knowledge transfer in distributed teams” or “cross-functional collaboration.” This can open up a whole new set of sources.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #f0e6e9; border-left: 4px solid #861f41; padding: 1em; margin-top: 2em;"><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for gaps. What <em>isn’t</em> being said in the sources you find? Noticing what’s missing can help you frame your report’s contribution more sharply.</p>
