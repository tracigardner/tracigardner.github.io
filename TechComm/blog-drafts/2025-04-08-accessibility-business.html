    <h1 style="color: #861f41;">Why Accessibility Makes Business Sense</h1>

    <p>When businesses invest in making their digital resources more accessible, they’re not just doing the right thing—they're making a smart strategic choice. Accessibility isn't about checking a box. It's about improving usability, increasing reach, and reducing risk.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">1. A More Usable Experience for Everyone</h2>
    <p>Accessible design often leads to clearer navigation, better color contrast, and cleaner layouts—features that benefit <em>all</em> users, not just those with disabilities. For example, captions help both people with hearing loss and anyone watching a video in a noisy environment.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">2. Expanding Your Audience</h2>
    <p>Roughly 1 in 4 adults in the U.S. lives with a disability. If your website or document isn't accessible, you're potentially excluding millions of people—including customers, employees, and stakeholders—from accessing your content or using your services.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">3. Reducing Legal and Compliance Risks</h2>
    <p>Many countries, including the U.S., have laws that require digital accessibility in the workplace and in public-facing communications. Making content accessible now helps avoid costly remediation efforts or legal challenges later.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">4. Supporting a Diverse Workforce</h2>
    <p>Inaccessible internal platforms can become productivity barriers for employees who use assistive technologies. When digital tools are designed with accessibility in mind, all employees can contribute more effectively and feel supported at work.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #f0e6e9; border-left: 4px solid #861f41; padding: 1em; margin-top: 2em;"><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Accessibility improves the user experience, reduces risk, and opens your business to a broader audience. It’s not an add-on—it’s just good design.</p>
