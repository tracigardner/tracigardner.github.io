    <h1 style="color: #861f41;">Why Accessibility Makes Business Sense</h1>

    <p>When businesses invest in making their digital resources more accessible, they&rsquo;re not just doing the right thing. They&rsquo;re making a smart strategic choice. Accessibility isn&rsquo;t about checking a box. It&rsquo;s about improving usability, increasing reach, and reducing risk.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">1. A More Usable Experience for Everyone</h2>

    <p>Accessible design often leads to clearer navigation, better color contrast, and cleaner layouts. These features benefit <em>all</em> users, not just those with disabilities. For example, captions help both people with hearing loss and anyone watching a video in a noisy environment.</p>

    <p>Research by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-accessibility-and-inclusion/understanding-accessibility-and-inclusion--2" target="_blank">UK Government Digital Service</a> shows that accessible design improves usability for everyone, not just those with disabilities. Additionally, a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/" target="_blank">Microsoft study on inclusive design</a> highlights that designing for people with permanent disabilities can also benefit those with situational or temporary impairments.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">2. Expanding Your Audience</h2>

    <p>Roughly 1 in 4 adults in the U.S. lives with a disability. If your website or document isn&rsquo;t accessible, you&rsquo;re potentially excluding millions of people&mdash;including customers, employees, and stakeholders&mdash;from accessing your content or using your products or services.</p>

    <p>According to the CDC, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html" target="_blank">27% of adults in the U.S. have some type of disability</a>. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that over <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health" target="_blank">1.3 billion people experience significant disability</a>, making accessibility essential for any organization seeking to reach and serve a wider market.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">3. Reducing Legal and Compliance Risks</h2>

    <p>Many countries, including the U.S., have laws that require digital accessibility in the workplace and in public-facing communications. Making content accessible now helps avoid costly remediation efforts or legal challenges later.</p>

    <p>In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act mandate digital accessibility in various sectors. Non-compliance has led to an increase in lawsuits: in 2023 alone, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/11/ada-website-lawsuits/70784731007/" target="_blank">over 4,600 digital accessibility lawsuits</a> were filed in federal court. Addressing accessibility from the outset reduces both legal exposure and the cost of retrofitting inaccessible content.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #e5751f;">4. Supporting a Diverse Workforce</h2>

    <p>Inaccessible internal platforms can become productivity barriers for employees who use assistive technologies. When digital tools are designed with accessibility in mind, all employees can contribute more effectively and feel supported at work.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://askjan.org/topics/costs.cfm" target="_blank">Job Accommodation Network</a> reports that most workplace accommodations cost little to nothing&mdash;while improving productivity and employee retention. Meanwhile, research from Accenture found that <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/inclusion-diversity/getting-equal-2018" target="_blank">companies that actively hire and support people with disabilities outperform their peers</a> in profitability and shareholder returns.</p>

    <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Accessibility improves the user experience, reduces risk, and opens your business to a broader audience. It&rsquo;s not an add-on. It&rsquo;s just good design.</p>
