    <h1>Set Up for Effective Collaboration on Your Proposal</h1>

    <p>Working on a proposal as a team can be challenging, but with the right approach, it can also be a rewarding experience that mirrors real-world professional collaboration. Here&rsquo;s how to set yourselves up for success.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Define Your Proposal&rsquo;s Focus</h2>
    <p>Before diving into writing, align on these key details:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pick a Website to Analyze:</strong> Select a real website that needs usability improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>Decide on Your Main Proposal Argument:</strong> What usability issues will you address? What kinds of improvements will you recommend?</li>
        <li><strong>Outline the Research Plan:</strong> Will you conduct surveys, analyze competitor websites, or gather usability testing data? Assign responsibilities for research collection. See the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/pages/week-10-instructions-conducting-research" target="_blank">Week 10 Module</a> for help.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 2: Write in Stages, Not All at Once</h2>
    <p>Avoid scrambling to finish the proposal the night before. Break it down into manageable parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>First:</strong> Select a website, define the problem, and outline the research plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Next:</strong> Collect research, draft key sections, and refine your argument.</li>
        <li><strong>Finally:</strong> Revise, add visuals, and proofread before submission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 3: Give and Accept Feedback</h2>
    <p>Feedback isn&rsquo;t personal&mdash;it&rsquo;s how teams produce stronger work! Be specific when offering suggestions. Instead of saying:</p>
    <blockquote>"This section doesn&rsquo;t make sense."</blockquote>
    <p>Try:</p>
    <blockquote>"Could we clarify this section by adding an example of how the proposed change will help users?"</blockquote>

    <h2>Step 4: Final Review and Submission</h2>
    <p>Before hitting submit, run through this checklist:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does the proposal follow the assignment guidelines?</li>
        <li>Are all sources cited properly?</li>
        <li>Is the writing clear, professional, and free of typos?</li>
        <li>Has someone outside the group read it for a fresh perspective?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bonus Tip: Don't Wait Until the Last Minute</h2>
    <p>Give yourselves a buffer. Plan to finish the draft at least two days before the deadline. That way, you have time to revise without stress.</p>

    <p>By following these steps, you&rsquo;ll not only produce a stronger proposal&mdash;you&rsquo;ll also gain teamwork skills that will serve you well in any workplace. Good luck, and happy writing!</p>
