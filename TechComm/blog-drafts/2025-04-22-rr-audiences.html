        <p><img src="images/three-reading-report.png" alt="A photo of three college students working at laptops" style="width: 300px;height: 300px;float:right;margin: 0px 0px 24px 15px;border-radius: 6px;">Abstracts, letters of transmittal, and executive summaries might seem similar&mdash;they all show up at the front of a report&mdash;but they serve <strong>very different purposes</strong> and audiences.</p>

        <p>Understanding the audience for each section helps you adjust your tone, language, and level of detail. The same report might be read by engineers, managers, and decision-makers&mdash;each with their own expectations. What you emphasize (and how you say it) should shift depending on who&rsquo;s reading.</p>

        <p>This post breaks down the intended readers and goals of each document, with examples to help you write clearly and purposefully. Whether you&rsquo;re helping someone decide whether to act, explaining technical details to someone doing the work, or showing managers what kind of support is needed, your writing needs to meet them where they are.</p>
