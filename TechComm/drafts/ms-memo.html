<h3>Optional Post: Looking at the Microsoft Memo</h3>
<p>Back in July, Microsoft Executive Vice President Stephen Elop released <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2014/jul14/07-17announcement2.aspx" title="Stephen Elop's email to employees">an email that was sent to all employees</a>, announcing layoffs and the reasons for the job cuts. At the time, many people criticized the email (for instance, <a target="_blank" href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/07/microsoft-lays-off-thousands-with-bad-memo.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microsoft Just Laid Off Thousands of Employees With a Hilariously Bad Memo</a>).</p>
<p>Read the original email and visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://forum.tracigardner.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=297" title="Optional: Microsoft Layoff Email">optional forum topic</a> to say what you think of the Microsoft email announcement. Having just read about writing memos and email messages, do you think it&rsquo;s as bad as the story says? How would you feel if you got this message? What could you do to improve it?</p>
