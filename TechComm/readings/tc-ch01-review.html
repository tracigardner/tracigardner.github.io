<h3 style="color: #e87722;">Chapter One Take-Aways</h3>
<p>If we were meeting in a classroom, I would go over important information in the class textbook with you, asking you to think about the information and how it might connect to your writing in the course and in the workplace..</p>
<p>This activity is a substitute for that discussion that we would have in class. I will summarize key information from the course documents and ask you to respond to related questions. It’s not a quiz on the information. </p>
<p>Because the accompanying information for some questions is long, each question appears on a separate page. All the information in this activity is also listed in the textbook. Your writing can be informal. Just be sure that I can understand what you have to say.</p>
<h3 style="color: #861f41;">What Is Technical Writing? </h3>
<p>Brainstorm a list of kinds of technical writing people do. You can include technical writing that takes place anywhere and in any situation. Don’t feel that you can only list writing in your career field. Aim to list 8–10 kinds of writing, broadly defined to include technical writing that uses words, images, video, and speaking.</p>
<h3 style="color: #861f41;">Characteristics of a Technical Document</h3>
<p>Almost every technical document that gets the job done has six major characteristics:</p>
<p><strong><img src="images/noun_read_1102783.png" width="100" height="84" alt="Person reading a book" style="float: right;"/>1. It addresses particular readers.</strong> Knowing who the readers are, what they understand about the subject, how well they speak a particular language, and how they will use the document will help you decide what kind of document to write, how to structure it, how much detail to include, and what sentence style and vocabulary to use.</p>
<p><strong><img src="images/noun_tools_1388490.png" width="101" height="84" alt="Screwdriver and crescent wrench" style="float: right;" />2. It helps readers solve problems.</strong> For instance, you might produce a video that explains to your company&rsquo;s employees how to select their employee benefits, or you might write a document spelling out the company&rsquo;s policy on using social media in the workplace.</p>
<p style="padding: 12px;border: 1px solid #861f41;background-color: #F8D6BD;">Think back to the list of kinds of writing you just brainstormed. Choose a couple of kinds of writing and explain what readers it addresses and how it helps readers solve problems. </p>
  <p><strong><img src="images/noun_Target_857266.png" width="104" height="83" alt="Target with an arrow in the bullseye" style="float: right;" />3. It reflects the organization&rsquo;s goals and culture.</strong> For example, a state government department that oversees vocational-education programs submits an annual report to the state legislature in an effort to secure continued funding, as well as a lot of technical information to the public in an effort to educate its audience. Although the connection may not be obvious, technical documents also reflect the organization&rsquo;s culture. For example, many organizations encourage their employees to blog about their areas of expertise to create a positive image of the organization.</p>
<p style="padding: 12px;border: 1px solid #861f41;background-color: #F8D6BD;">One kind of technical writing is documentation and instructions. Think about the Virginia Tech resources that provide documentation or instructions (for example, instructions on the 4Help website, or instructions that tell you how to complete a task on HokieSpa). What features can you think of that tell you right away that the documents relate to Virginia Tech? How do the instructions reflect the university’s goals and culture?</p>
  <p><strong><img src="images/noun_team_3831577.png" width="100" height="72" alt="Team of three women" style="float: right;"/>4. It is produced collaboratively. </strong>No one person has all the information, skills, or time needed to create a large document. You will work with subject-matter experts — the various technical professionals — to create a better document than you could have made working alone. You will routinely post questions to networks of friends and associates — both inside and outside your own organization — to get answers to technical questions.</p>
<p style="padding: 12px;border: 1px solid #861f41;background-color: #F8D6BD;">How do you feel about collaborative projects? People usually love group work or they hate it. 

  </p><p><strong>5. <img src="images/noun_design_3623594.png" width="106" height="84" alt="Computer with design tools" style="float: right;"/>It uses design to increase readability. </strong>Technical communicators use design features — such as typography, spacing, and color — to make a document not only more attractive but also more usable, so that it creates a positive impression and is easy to navigate and understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>6. <img src="images/noun_analytics_50975.png" width="91" height="85" alt="Report with text and images shown on a smartphone" style="float: right;" />It consists of words or images or both.</strong> Images — both static and moving — can make a document more interesting and appealing to readers and can help the writer communicate and reinforce difficult concepts, communicate instructions and descriptions of objects and processes, communicate large amounts of quantifiable data, and communicate with nonnative speakers.</p>
