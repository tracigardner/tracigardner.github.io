    <p>Since this course takes place entirely online, you have to know how to use Canvas to do well. Nearly everything happens in Canvas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You find your readings and assignments.</li>
      <li>You participate in discussions with others in the class.</li>
      <li>You turn in your work and assess yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have questions about Canvas, now is your chance to learn more about it. Even if you don&rsquo;t come to this course with questions, you&rsquo;re bound to learn something</p>
    <p>The links below explain how to use the tools that are most important in this course. Follow these instructions for this activity:</p>
    <ol>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">Read through the entire list (just the list below, not all those articles) to get an idea of the help you can find here. You can return to this Discussion later in the term if you need help with one of these tasks.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">Choose at least one task that you would like to know more about. If you are unsure which to choose, I suggest you select the question on <strong>Modules</strong>, since you will use them every week.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">Read the details on the task you chose, and explore the related tool.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">Write a reply that tells me (and your classmates) something new that you learned about Canvas.</li>
      <li>If you have any questions about Canvas, you can include those too, and we’ll try to find an answer.</li>
    </ol>
