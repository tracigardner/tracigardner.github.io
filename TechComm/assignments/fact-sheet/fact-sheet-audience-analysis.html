        <p>Before creating your one-page (front &amp; back) fact sheet, take time to think about the people you are writing it for. Your goal is to help everyday community members &mdash; those directly affected by the issue&mdash;better understand what&rsquo;s at stake, how it may impact them, and what they can do (if anything) in response.</p>
        <p>Your audience may include families, residents, workers, students, caregivers, or others in the community. These are the people served by the decision-makers and public systems to whom you addressed your informational report&mdash;but they are not necessarily involved in those systems themselves.</p>

                <li>Identify a real-world community audience for a public-facing document.</li>
                <li>Understand how audience needs and knowledge shape tone, content, and design.</li>
                <li>Anticipate what community members may already know&mdash;and what they still need to understand&mdash;about an important issue.</li>
                <li>Plan effective ways to present information clearly, concisely, and accessibly.</li>
                <li>Consider how to build trust with readers and motivate their interest or action.</li>
                <li>Practice using audience analysis to create user-friendly, purpose-driven documents.</li>

        <h3>Grading &amp; Revision</h3>
        <p>Canvas automatically grades your quiz when you submit it. I will review your submission to ensure you have chosen and analyzed an appropriate audience of non-expert readers who need to make a decision about your topic.</p>
        <p>I may adjust your grade to an <strong>Incomplete</strong> in two situations:</p>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li>If you have not analyzed an appropriate audience of non-expert readers who need to make a decision about your topic.</li>
            <li>If you did not adequately analyze your audience (e.g., your responses are not specific or detailed, the answers do not show sufficient effort, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In both cases, you can revise. If you do and then resubmit your audience analysis, I will reassess your work.</p>
