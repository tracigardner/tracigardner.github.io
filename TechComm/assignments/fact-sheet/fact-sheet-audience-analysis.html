        <p>Before creating your one-page fact sheet, take time to think about the people you are writing it for. Your goal is to help everyday community members &mdash; those directly affected by the issue &mdash; better understand what&rsquo;s at stake, how it may impact them, and what they can do (if anything) in response.</p>
        <p>Your audience may include families, residents, workers, students, caregivers, or others in the community. These are the people served by the decision-makers and public systems to whom you addressed your informational report &mdash; but not necessarily involved in those systems themselves.</p>
        <p>In this assignment, you will write a 500&ndash;700 word audience analysis that explores who your readers are and how you will meet their needs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write one paragraph for each of the six questions below.</li>
            <li>Use a clear, informative heading for each paragraph.</li>
            <li>Focus on plain language and real-world understanding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Tip: Draft your analysis in Google Docs or Word, then copy and paste it into the assignment text box.</span></strong></em></p>
        <h2><span style="color: #880000;"><strong>Assignment Objectives</strong></span></h2>
        <p>By completing this assignment, you will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify a real-world community audience for a public-facing document.</li>
            <li>Understand how audience needs and knowledge shape tone, content, and design.</li>
            <li>Anticipate what community members may already know&mdash;and what they still need to understand&mdash;about an important issue.</li>
            <li>Plan effective ways to present information clearly, concisely, and accessibly.</li>
            <li>Consider how to build trust with readers and motivate their interest or action.</li>
            <li>Practice using audience analysis to create user-friendly, purpose-driven documents.</li>
        </ul>

            <p>========================================== Understanding your audience is a key skill in technical writing. Before you begin writing your informational report, you need to understand the audience you&rsquo;re writing for. A well-informed audience analysis will help you shape a report that not only informs, but also persuades&mdash;giving your audience the tools they need to act on an issue that matters.</p>
            <p>This activity will help you identify what your audience already knows, what they need to learn, and how best to present your information so that it is clear, useful, and persuasive.</p>
            <h3>Assignment Overview</h3>
            <p>Choose the scenario you will focus on for your report. Then, identify your intended audience: <strong>a specific group of non-expert decision-makers who have the authority to act on the issue.</strong> Example audiences include local government officials, nonprofit leaders, community organization staff, or school administrators.</p>
            <p>Answer each of the questions below to analyze your audience for the Informational Report. The answers to all the questions should add up to 500&ndash;700 words, but don&rsquo;t worry if it&rsquo;s a little long or a little short.</p>
            <h3>Assignment Objectives</h3>

                <summary>
                    <span class="triangle" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <span class="show-when-open"><strong>Hide the Learning Objectives</strong></span>

                </summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand the role of audience in shaping the content, tone, and purpose of an informational report.</li>
                    <li>Identify specific decision-making audiences and analyze their authority, responsibilities, and interests.</li>
                    <li>Assess what an audience already knows&mdash;and what they need to know&mdash;to fully understand a social justice or equity-related issue.</li>
                    <li>Determine the types of evidence and examples that will be most persuasive to a particular audience.</li>
                    <li>Anticipate audience concerns, questions, or objections, and plan how to address them respectfully.</li>
                    <li>Practice writing clearly and concisely using headings, bullet points, and accessible language.</li>
                    <li>Strengthen research and critical thinking skills by examining real-world stakeholders and their information needs.</li>
                    <li>Build a foundation for writing purpose-driven, reader-centered documents in academic and professional settings.</li>
                </ul>
            </details>
            <h3>Grading &amp; Revision</h3>
            <p>Canvas automatically grades your quiz when you submit it. I will review your submission to ensure you have chosen and analyzed an appropriate audience of non-expert readers who need to make a decision about your topic.</p>
            <p>I may adjust your grade to an <strong>Incomplete</strong> in two situations:</p>
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li>If you have not analyzed an appropriate audience of non-expert readers who need to make a decision about your topic.</li>
                <li>If you did not adequately analyze your audience (e.g., your responses are not specific or detailed, the answers do not show sufficient effort, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In both cases, you can revise. If you do and then resubmit your audience analysis, I will reassess your work.</p>
