  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <figure style="float: center;margin: 0px 0px 9px 9px;">
        <img src="../../-images/recommendation/Rec-report-body-methods.png" alt="Flowchart showing this is the second section of the report body: 1. Introduction. What is this document about? 2. Methods. What did you do? 3. Results. What did you see or determine? 4. Conclusions. What does it mean? 5. Recommendations. What should we do?" width="792" height="146">

<p>The Methods section is where you tell your readers about the research you did. You explain exactly what you did to gather the information for your report. However  save the details on what you found out for the Results section. Do not include them in your Methods section.</p>
<h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>
<ul>
  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">The details on the Methods Section, from p. 493:<br>
        “The methods section answers the question ‘What did you do?’ In drafting the methods section, consider your readers&rsquo; knowledge of the field, their perception of you, and the uniqueness of the project, as well as their reasons for reading the report and their attitudes toward the project. Provide enough information to enable readers to understand what you did and why you did it that way. If others will be using the report to duplicate your methods, include sufficient detail.”</li>
      <li class="skipline">Example  Methods Section, on pp.512–515 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">LinkedIn Learning video, “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/technical-writing-reports/include-methodology-and-procedures?u=57888345" target="_target">Include methodology and procedures</a>” (4m 11s), from the Technical Writing: Reports course.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>How You Do It</h2>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Return to your Design Description, Instructions, and research, and locate all the information you recorded on design concepts and your analysis of your website (both primary and secondary research). </li>
  <li class="skipline">Open the word processor document where you are working on your recommendation report. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Scroll through the outline you created to the location for your Methods section.</li>
        <div class="maroonbox" style="width: 330px;float: right;margin-left: 12px;padding: 6px;">
        <h4>Tips for Writing Sub-Headings</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the  headings in the Methods Section of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8 of the textbook as a model.</li>
        <li>If you are unsure where to begin, start with a section for each design concept that you analyzed the website for.</li>
        <li>Consult the advice in the “Writing Clear, Informative Headings,” section on pp. 199–202 (in Chapter 9 of the textbook).</li>
        <li>Use the help on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/professional-design-for-reports" target="_blank">Professional Design for Reports page</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <li class="skipline">Make any changes necessary to the headings for the sub-sections of your Methods Section:
    <ul>
      <li>If you have already worked on your Results Section, copy the sub-headings from your Results Section to the Methods Section. The sub-headings in these two sections typically match.</li>
      <li>If you have not worked on your Methods Section, choose one of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>If you added sub-sections when you created your outline, check your headings to ensure that you have included all the tasks you completed in your research. </li>
          <li>If you did not include sub-sections in your outline, add them now, covering all the tasks that you completed in your research.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Write the content for the Methods Section:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Describe the process that you followed as you analyzed your website, explaining what you looked for and the order you looked in. Use your Instructions as a reference.</li>
      <li>Explain each of the concepts that you analyzed on your website. If appropriate, you can include your Design Description as part of your Methods section. You can  add similar descriptions for the other concepts you have included as you analyzed your website.</li>
      <li>Expand on the information with other notes and information that you have.</li>
      <li>Mention your Instructions specifically and indicate that they are included in your Appendix. [Note: The Instructions document itself will go in an appendix, not in the Methods section. Just describe what you did here.]</li>
      <li>Work back through the information you have added to make sure you have sentences and clear ideas.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Review the section and make any additions or changes, using the information from the textbook and LinkedIn Learning videos as needed. At this point, focus in particular in making sure that you have included everything that answers the question, &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; </li>
  <li class="skipline">Move on to the next part of the report that you want to work on.   </li>
