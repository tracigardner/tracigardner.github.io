At the same time, titles should include clear and direct language without wordiness or redundancy.</p>
<p>The worst titles tell the reader nothing about the document. Here are some examples of poorly chosen titles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Paper #3</li>
  <li>Recommendation</li>
  <li>My Report</li>
  <li>Rough Draft</li>
</ul>
<p>Those titles tell you nothing about the related document. As an analogy, would you ever go see <em>Movie #2 </em> or<em> RomCom</em>? Probably not. You expect a movie title to tell you something  about what you are going to see. The same concept applies to technical writing.</p>
<h3>Find the Right Words for Your  Title</h3>
<ol>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Begin with the keywords you used in your research.</strong><br>
    Think about the words that say exactly what your report is about, and jot those words down. Your keywords should describe the subject area. For your report, your keywords should include the kind of writing that you are studying.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Next, add any words to your list that describe the kind of writing you are doing. </strong><br>
    In our case, you are writing a recommendation report, so add those words if they are not already on your list.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Consider the specific situation for your report. </strong><br>
    Write down any specific place, person, concept, object, or other entity that is involved in your topic. Review the words and phrases you already have written down and make them specific to your research. For example, let’s say you wrote down the word <em>military</em>. Make that more specific. Which branch of the military? What specific part of that branch? What particular kind of people? With a little work, you can go from the general <em>military</em> to the very specific <em>special agents in naval crime investigation </em>or <em>the mountain  phase of Army Ranger School</em>.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Once you have your list of words, choose the most significant ones and use them to create your title. </strong><br>
    Remember that you can change the word form as necessary to fit your title. For a recommendation report, for instance, you could consider different forms of the word <em>recommend</em>, such as recommendation, recommending, recommended, and to recommend.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Finally cut out any unnecessary words to make your title clear and direct. </strong><br>
    Make sure you remove any redundancy. Watch for a pile-up of prepositional phrases. Try reading the title out loud. If you stumble on the words or run out of breath, you probably need to revise.</li>
</ol>
<h3> How to Improve Titles</h3>
<p class="text-danger" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>Original Title:</strong> How to Properly Prepare Food Supplies for an Emergency Situation</p>
<p class="text-success" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>Improved Title:</strong> Preparing Emergency Food Supplies</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Changes:</strong></p>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>“How to Properly Prepare” can be condensed to one word: “Preparing.” </li>
  <li>The word <em>proper</em> isn’t needed at all. Who is going to focus on  improper preparation? </li>
  <li>The idea behind the phrase “for an Emergency Situation” can be expressed by keeping just the word “Emergency” and using it as an adjective for “Food Supplies.”</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-danger" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>Original Title:</strong> Recommendations and Findings for Eating Vegan on Campus: A Guide to Dining Hall Options</p>
<p class="text-success" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>Improved Title:</strong> Recommendations for Eating Vegan on Campus</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">“Recommendations and Findings” is redundant. Just use  <em>recommendations.</em></li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">The phrases “on Campus” and “Dining Hall Options” communicate the same idea. Drop one.</li>
</ul>
