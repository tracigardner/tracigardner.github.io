    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Focus on Audience</h4>
    <p>Address readers at the management-level in your executive summary. Focus on the information that managers need to provide support and leadership so that others can do the  work to make your recommendations happen. Your readers would include people who work in purchasing, PR, hiring, and supervisors. You are telling these readers what they need to do to provide the resources and support to make your recommendations happen.</p>

  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">The details on the Executive Summary, from p. 499–500:
        <ul>
          <li>An Executive Summary “is a brief condensation of the report addressed to managers. Most managers need only a broad understanding of the projects that an organization undertakes and how they fit together into a coherent whole.”</li>
          <li>“The executive summary presents information to managers in two parts:
            <ul>
              <li>Background. This section explains the problem or opportunity: what was not working or was not working effectively or efficiently, or what potential modification of a procedure or product had to be analyzed.</li>
              <li>Major findings and implications. This section might include a brief description — only one or two sentences — of the methods, followed by a full paragraph about the conclusions and recommendations.”</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>“GUIDELINES: Writing an Executive Summary,” on p. 500.</li>

  </ul>
<h2>How You Do It</h2>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Complete a draft of the body sections of your report (<a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/151634/pages/writing-your-introduction" target="_blank">Introduction</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/151634/pages/writing-your-methods-section" target="_blank">Methods</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/151634/pages/writing-your-results-section" target="_blank">Results</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/151634/pages/writing-your-conclusions-section" target="_blank">Conclusions</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/151634/pages/writing-your-recommendations-section" target="_blank">Recommendations</a>) before beginning your Executive Summary. It’s easier to summarize the report if you have already written it.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Add the heading for your Executive Summary:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Add the phrase <em>Executive Summary </em>as the heading at the top of the page and center the line. </li>
      <li>Format the word so that it is clearly the heading for the page. You can use the built-in headings in your word processor. See the Tech Tip on p. 55 for help.</li>
      <li>Skip a blank line.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Write the content of your Executive Summary, all in one paragraph, focusing on the audience of people with technical knowledge of the topic:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Begin by explaining the background and purpose of the report.</li>
      <li>Summarize the research methods you used.</li>
      <li>Explain the main findings, providing relevant technical information.</li>
      <li>Close with your major recommendations, again providing relevant technical information.</li>
      <li>Skip a blank line.</li>
      <li>Add the label “Keywords:”</li>
      <li>List the keywords for your report, separating them with commas. </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Review your Abstract to confirm  that you include appropriate technical information and terminology. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Move on to the next part of your report that you want to work on. </li>
  <li class="skipline"></li>
  <li class="skipline">xxx</li>
  <li class="skipline">xxx</li>
  <li class="skipline">Skip a blank line.</li>

          <td><strong>“Use specific evidence in describing the background.</strong> For most managers, the best evidence is in the form of costs and savings. Instead of writing that the equipment you are now using to cut metal foil is ineffective, write that the equipment jams once every 72 hours on average, costing $400 in materials and $2,000 in productivity each time. Then add up these figures for a monthly or an annual total.” (p. 500)</td>

  <li class="skipline">Consider your document design. The executive summary can include features that help your readers find the key information. Consider how you might incorporate lists, headings, and boldface, and make the relevant changes.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Review your Executive Summary and make any additions or changes, using the information from the textbook and LinkedIn Learning video as needed. Because the Executive Summary is for management, be sure that you define any technical terminology.  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Move on to the next part of your report that you want to work on.</li>
