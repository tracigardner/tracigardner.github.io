      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Focus on Audience</h4>
      <p>Address readers at the management-level in your executive summary. Focus on the information that managers need to provide support and leadership so that others can do the work to make your recommendations happen. Your readers would include people who work in purchasing, PR, hiring, and supervisors. You are telling these readers what they need to do to provide the resources and support to make your recommendations happen.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>An Executive Summary “is a brief condensation of the report addressed to managers. Most managers need only a broad understanding of the projects that an organization undertakes and how they fit together into a coherent whole.”</li>
              <li>“The executive summary presents information to managers in two parts:
                <ul>
                  <li>Background. This section explains the problem or opportunity: what was not working or was not working effectively or efficiently, or what potential modification of a procedure or product had to be analyzed.</li>
                  <li>Major findings and implications. This section might include a brief description — only one or two sentences — of the methods, followed by a full paragraph about the conclusions and recommendations.”</li>

    <h2>How You Do It</h2>
    <ol class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">Complete a draft of the body sections of your report (<a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/166227/pages/writing-your-introduction" target="_blank">Introduction</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/166227/pages/writing-your-methods-section" target="_blank">Methods</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/166227/pages/writing-your-results-section" target="_blank">Results</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/166227/pages/writing-your-conclusions-section" target="_blank">Conclusions</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/166227/pages/writing-your-recommendations-section" target="_blank">Recommendations</a>) before beginning your Executive Summary. It’s easier to summarize the report if you have already written it.</li>
      <li class="skipline">Add the heading for your Executive Summary:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Add the phrase <em>Executive Summary</em> as the heading at the top of the page and center the line.</li>
          <li>Format the word so that it is clearly the heading for the page. You can use the built-in headings in your word processor. See the Tech Tip on p. 55 for help.</li>
          <li>Skip a blank line.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="skipline">Write the content of your Executive Summary, focusing on information that managers need to know:
        <dl>
          <dt>Paragraph 1</dt>
          <dd>Begin with a brief statement of the subject of your report. Provide For an example, see the first paragraph of the Executive Summary in the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 509. </dd>
          <dt>Paragraph 2</dt>
          <dd>Provide background details on your study, using specific evidence. See additional details in Guidelines: Writing an Executive Summary on p. 500. For an example, check out the second paragraph of the Executive Summary in the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 509.</dd>
          <dt>Paragraph 3</dt>
          <dd>Describe the research tasks you focused on in your study, using clear and direct language.
            See the third paragraph of the Executive Summary in the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 509 for help.</dd>
          <dt>Paragraph 4</dt>
          <dd>Explain the main findings and conclusions of your research. See the fourth paragraph of the Executive Summary in the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 509 for an example.</dd>
          <dt>Paragraph 5</dt>
          <dd>Conclude with your recommendation, including brief details supporting your suggestions. Explain why your recommendation is the best option to follow. See the fifth paragraph of the Executive Summary in the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 509 for help.</dd>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li class="skipline">Review your Executive Summary to confirm that you include all the information that readers of your report will need. </li>
      <li class="skipline">Move on to the next part of your report that you want to work on. </li>
