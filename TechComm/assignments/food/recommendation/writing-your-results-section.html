    <h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
        <ul class="skipline">
          <li class="skipline">The details on the Results Section, from pp. 493–494:<br>
            “Results are the data you discovered or compiled. Present the results objectively, without comment. Save the interpretation of the results&mdash;your conclusions&mdash;for later. If you combine results and conclusions, your readers might be unable to follow your reasoning and might not be able to tell whether the evidence justifies your conclusions. Your audience&rsquo;s needs will help you decide how to structure the results. How much they know about the subject, what they plan to do with the report, what they expect your recommendation(s) to be&mdash;these and many other factors will affect how you present the results.”</li>
          <li class="skipline">Example Results Section, on pp. 516–522 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="skipline">LinkedIn Learning video, “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/technical-writing-reports/understand-the-findings-section?u=57888345" target="_blank">Understand the findings section</a>” (4m 9s), from the Technical Writing: Reports course. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How You Do It</h2>
    <ol class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">Add the heading for your Results section:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Add the word <em>Results</em> as the heading at the top of the page and center the line. You can also use the heading <em>Findings</em>.</li>
          <li>Format the word so that it is clearly the heading for the page. You can use the built-in headings in your word processor. See the Tech Tip on p. 55 for help.</li>
          <li>Skip a blank line.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="skipline">Write the opening paragraph for the Results section. This short paragraph provides an advance organizer for the rest of the Results section. See the example opening in the first paragraph of the Results section in the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 516 of the textbook for help.</li>
      <li class="skipline">For each task you identified in your research process in the Methods section, add a matching subsection with details on your research findings in the Results section. Follow these guidelines for each Task subsection:<br>
        <div class="maroonbox" style="width: 330px;float: right;margin-left: 12px;padding: 6px;">
          <h4>Tips for Writing Sub-Headings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the subheadings in the Results Section of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8 of the textbook as a model.</li>
            <li>Consult the advice in the “Writing Clear, Informative Headings,” section on pp. 199–202 (in Chapter 9 of the textbook).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <dl>
          <dt>Task Heading</dt>
          <dd>
            <ul>
              <li>Copy the subsection task headings from the Methods Section to your Results section. Each task heading identifies the task by number and provides a brief statement of the task. Ideally your subheading should be approximately 1 to 1½ lines.</li>
              <li>Format your subheading so that it is different from the paragraphs in the body and matches the subheadings in the Methods section. You can use the built-in headings in your word processor. See the Tech Tip on p. 55 for help.</li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
          <dt>Task Details</dt>
          <dd>Provide the relevant details under each heading. Include the following information:
            <ul>
              <li>Explain what you found as a result of your research. Provide the details objectively. Save your commentary for the Conclusions section.</li>
              <li>Outline any limitations to the data you collected, such as any information that you could not verify or options that were not examined.</li>
              <li>Add in-text citations for outside sources that you mention (for instance, books, websites, or videos) as you explain your findings. Make sure that any information you quote from your primary or secondary research is enclosed in quotation marks. Follow the documentation style that is used in your field. See the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/166227/pages/documentation-and-citations-for-your-projects" target="_blank">Documentation and Citations for Your Projects</a> page for help.</li>
              <li>Review the information in your subsection, and chunk the information into short paragraphs. The exact number of paragraphs in each of subsections will depend upon the specific details of your research process. See p. 265 for information on chunking. </li>
              <li>You can also use bulleted lists if appropriate. See Guidelines: Creating Effective Lists on pp. 205–206 for additional help.</li>
              <li>See Task 1–6 in the Results section of the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 516–522 of the textbook for help.</li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li class="skipline">Compare the subheadings you have included with the tasks you have listed elsewhere in the document. Ensure that they all use the same phrasing. </li>
      <li class="skipline">Review your Results section to make sure that you have included everything that answers the question, &ldquo;What did you see or determine?&rdquo; </li>
      <li class="skipline">Move on to the next part of your report that you want to work on.</li>
