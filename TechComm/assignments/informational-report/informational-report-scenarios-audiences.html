    <title>Sample Scenarios & Decision-Making Audiences</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Review these sample scenarios and the related decision-making audiences for the Informational Report for Non-Expert Readers. These examples also apply to your Research Proposal, where you provide a clear, detailed plan for your Informational Report.</p>

    <p>To be appropriate for the assignment, you&rsquo;d update the scenarios and audiences for a specific location or situation. For example, consider the first subject, Improving Food Access in Urban Areas. You&rsquo;d update that topic to a specific urban area (e.g., Richmond, Virginia). Likewise, you&rsquo;d update the audience to specific groups or people (e.g., Richmond City Council or Dennis Hatchett, President and CEO of <a href="https://feedmore.org/" target="_blank">Feed More</a>).</p>
