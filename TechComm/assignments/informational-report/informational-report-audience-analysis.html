        <p><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/assignments/noun-audience-7645025-333333.png" alt="" style="float: right; margin: 12px;  width: 180px;height: 180px;">Understanding your audience is a key skill in technical writing. Before you begin writing your informational report, you need to understand the audience you&rsquo;re writing for. A well-informed audience analysis will help you shape a report that not only informs, but also persuades&mdash;giving your audience the tools they need to act on an issue that matters.</p>

        <p>This activity will help you identify what your audience already knows, what they need to learn, and how best to present your information so that it is clear, useful, and persuasive.</p>


        <h3>Assignment Overview</h3>
        <p>Choose the scenario you will focus on for your report. Then, identify your intended audience: <strong>a specific group of non-expert decision-makers who have the authority to act on the issue.</strong> Example audiences include local government officials, nonprofit leaders, community organization staff, or school administrators.</p>

        <p>Answer each of the questions below to analyze your audience for the Informational Report. The answers to all the questions should add up to 500&ndash;700 words, but don&rsquo;t worry if it&rsquo;s a little long or a little short.</p>

        </details>

        <h3>Grading &amp; Revision</h3>
        <p>Canvas automatically grades your quiz when you submit it. I will review your submission to ensure you have chosen and analyzed an appropriate audience of non-expert readers who need to make a decision about your topic.</p>
        <p>I may adjust your grade to an <strong>Incomplete</strong> in two situations:</p>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li>If you have not analyzed an appropriate audience of non-expert readers who need to make a decision about your topic.</li>
            <li>If you did not adequately analyze your audience (e.g., your responses are not specific or detailed, the answers do not show sufficient effort, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In both cases, you can revise. If you do and then resubmit your audience analysis, I will reassess your work.</p>
