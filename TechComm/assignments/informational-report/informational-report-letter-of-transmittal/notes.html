    <h1>Outline: Letter of Transmittal for an Informational Report</h1>

    <p>The letter of transmittal introduces your report to its reader. It provides context, explains purpose, and sets an objective tone before the report begins. Keep it brief&mdash;usually one page, with 3&ndash;4 short paragraphs.</p>

    <h2>Paragraph 1: Purpose and Context</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>State that you are submitting the report and give its title.</li>
        <li>Briefly explain why the report was prepared (the assignment, request, or decision context).</li>
        <li>Example: “I am pleased to submit my informational report, <em>Electric Vehicle Charging Access in Small Communities</em>, prepared to inform city planners about equitable infrastructure options.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Paragraph 2: Report Overview</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Summarize the report’s subject in 2–3 sentences.</li>
        <li>Explain what the report covers—its main sections or focus areas.</li>
        <li>Emphasize that the report’s goal is to <strong>inform</strong>, not persuade.</li>
        <li>Example: “This report defines current charging technologies, presents recent usage data, and outlines accessibility considerations for non-urban drivers.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Paragraph 3: Audience and Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the intended readers or decisionmakers.</li>
        <li>Explain how the report may assist them in understanding or evaluating the topic.</li>
        <li>Example: “The information is intended to support local officials and community advocates as they evaluate future transportation initiatives.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Paragraph 4: Closing and Courtesy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Thank the reader for their attention or the opportunity to prepare the report.</li>
        <li>Offer to provide additional information if needed.</li>
        <li>End with a professional closing (e.g., “Sincerely”) and your name.</li>
        <li>Example: “Thank you for the opportunity to explore this topic. Please let me know if I can provide any further clarification.”</li>
    </ul>
