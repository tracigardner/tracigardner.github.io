        <p>Create a professional bio that tells everyone in your Project Group about your background, work, and interests. Since we are all Hokies, be sure to address your <em>Ut Prosim</em> beliefs and actions.</p>
        <h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
        <p>A professional bio introduces new employees in the workplace or updates staff when an employee takes on new responsibilities (like a promotion). On campus, your department or college may post professional bios when they give out awards and special honors.</p>

        <p>We will use them to introduce ourselves. I want you to write something more than the boring self-introduction discussion thread, and this project gets beyond that kind of writing while also letting you practice a kind of writing frequently used in the workplace.</p>

        <h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>
        <p>There are many options for help with your bio. Choose the ones that fit your career field and/or that seem most useful to you. I do not expect you to read all of these. You should definitely look at some example bios so that you know what your bio should look like.</p>

        <h2>How You Do It</h2>
        <ol class="skipline">
            <li class="skipline">Think about the specific audience and purpose for your bio: <br>
                <table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="6">
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <th width="19%" scope="col">Audience </th>
                            <th width="81%" scope="col">Purpose</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Classmates</td>
                            <td>Tell them who you are so that you feel comfortable working together and can set up an accountability group</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Traci (your teacher)</td>
                            <td>Tell me who you are and what you&rsquo;re interested in so that I can provide more effective feedback</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </li>
            <li>Write your biography statement here in this Discussion in Canvas. Write directly in Canvas so that readers do not need to download a document to find out who you are. The idea is to make it easy for your reader.</li>
            <li>Keep the following requirements in mind as you write:
                <ul>
                    <li>Include strong, specific details that tell readers who you are and help them get to know you. </li>
                    <li>Use current information. Don&rsquo;t make up anything. Your readers want to know who you really are.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add a photo to your bio that connects to the info in your bio. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a photo of yourself, but it can be. You can include more than one photo if you want to. Here are some examples of kinds of photos that work:
                <div class="maroonbox" style="float: right;width: 240px;">
                    <strong style="color: #c64600;">Tip:</strong> Avoid photos from prom, Ring Dance, and weddings. They look out of place because they are not from a setting that connects to your career field.
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>A business-casual or business photo of yourself. </li>
                    <li>A photo of a pet, and you mention the pet in your bio (especially useful if you are in pre-Vet or Animal Sciences).</li>
                    <li>A photo of yourself doing something relevant to your career (like working on a construction site if you&rsquo;re a Building Construction major).</li>
                    <li>A photo of yourself participating in a hobby or special interests (like an outlook on a hiking trial for someone interested in hiking or backpacking). Again be sure you talk about the hobby or special interest in your bio. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Read back through the posts from your classmates to find people you can connect with or whom you already know. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to Assess &amp; Track Your Work</h2>
        <p>You track your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Work is always marked as either 1 for Complete or 0 for Incomplete:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I will mark this activity <em>Complete</em> in Canvas Grades, usually within 24–48 hours after the end of the grace period.</li>
            <li>I will mark this activity <em>Incomplete</em> in Canvas Grades if you do not submit your log by the end of the grace period.</li>
        </ul>
