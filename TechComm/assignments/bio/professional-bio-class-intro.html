    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> analyze your audience and purpose so that you can choose the best way to present information clearly and effectively. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 1]</li>
      <li>work collaboratively and individually to compose and publish texts in digital environments. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 5]</li>
      <li>write documents you may encounter in the workplace, such as letters, memos, proposals, reports, and presentations. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 4]</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
    <p>Create a professional biographical statement that tells everyone in the class about your background, your work, and your interests. A professional bio is often used in the workplace as an introduction of a new employee or when an employee takes on new responsibilities (like a promotion). On campus, your department or college may post professional bios when they give out awards and special honors. </p>
    <h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
    <p>At this point in your college progress, you probably have a resume. You may even have a job secured for the future, after you graduate. This assignment is a kind of job application project (since it includes details from your resume or cover letter), but it asks you to frame the details differently. Your biographical statement tells the world who you are as a professional in your career field, what you value, and what your goals are. </p>
    <p>We will use them in this class to introduce ourselves to one another. I want you to write something more than the boring self-introduction discussion thread, and this project gets beyond that kind of writing while also letting you practice a kind of writing frequently used in the workplace.</p>

    <h3>When to Do It</h3>
    <p>Submit your work: </p>
    <ul class="null">
      <li>Submit your work here by 11:59 PM on Friday, April 30.</li>
      <li>If you need more time, use the grace period and submit your work by 11:59 PM on Monday, May 3. <br>
        Why? Introductions to the class need to happen at the beginning of the course. They don’ t make sense at the end of the term.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How You Do It</h3>
    <ol class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">Think about the specific audience and purpose for your bio: <br>
        <table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="6">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th width="33%" scope="col">Audience </th>
              <th width="67%" scope="col">Purpose</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Classmates</td>
              <td>Tell them who you are so that you feel comfortable working together</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Traci (your teacher)</td>
              <td>Tell me who you are and what you’re interested in so that I can provide more effective feedback</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li>Write your biography statement here in the Bio Statements Discussion in Canvas. Write directly in Canvas so that readers do not need to download a document to find out who you are. The idea is to make it easy for your reader.</li>
      <li>Keep the following requirements in mind as you write:
        <ul>
          <li>Include strong, specific details that tell readers who you are and help them get to know you. </li>
          <li>Use current information. Don’t make up anything. Your readers want to know who you really are.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Add a photo to your bio that connects to the info in your bio. It doesn’t have to be a photo of yourself, but it can be. You can include more than one photo if you want to. Here are some examples of kinds of photos that work:
        <ul>
          <li>A business-casual or business photo of yourself. </li>
          <li>A photo of a pet, and you mention the pet in your bio.</li>
          <li>A photo of yourself doing something relevant to your career (like working on a construction site if you’re a Building Construction major).</li>
          <li>A photo of yourself participating in a hobby or special interest activity (like playing soccer). Be sure you talk about the hobby or special interest in your bio.</li>
          <li>A photo related to your hobby or special interests (like an outlook on a hiking trial for someone interested in hiking or backpacking). Again be sure you talk about the hobby or special interest in your bio.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to Assess and Track Your Work</h2>
    <p>You track and grade your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li>Track your work (both your bio and your replies) in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
      <li>Come back to the Discussion to read about your classmates and add replies. The idea is to get to know one another.</li>
