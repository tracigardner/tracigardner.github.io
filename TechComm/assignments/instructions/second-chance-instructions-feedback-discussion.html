<h2>What You Will Learn and Practice</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Collaborate with classmates in planning, researching, writing, revising, and presenting information. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 5]</li>
</ul>
<h2><img src="../../-images/noun_Brainstorm_1453606.png" width="200" height="187" alt="Icon showing four speech bubbles" style="float:right;margin: 0px 0px 12px 12px;" />What I Want You to Do</h2>
<p>Add a cover letter to your Instructions that tells your peer review readers about your draft and asks any questions that you have about  it. After adding your cover page, submit the current draft for feedback. After peer review partners are assigned, read drafts from your classmates and offer feedback on how to revise.</p>
<h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
<p>You will give feedback and get feedback from others in your class on the work you are doing. These activities focus on  how to give and take advice that will improve your writing. There are two situations people may complete this activity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The writer needed more time, so they couldn’t participate in the first peer review.</li>
  <li>The writer participated in the first peer review, but they want additional feedback on the revisions they have made.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>When to Do It</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li><strong>   Firm  Draft Due Dates: </strong>Post your draft by 11:59 PM on Wednesday, September 29, 2021. This firm deadline is necessary for Canvas to assign peer review pairs automatically. </li>
  <li><strong>Peer Review Feedback:</strong> Post your feedback to classmates by 11:59 PM on Monday, October 4, 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>How You Do It</h2>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Complete as much of your draft as you can before the second-chance feedback discussion due date. Your readers do not expect a finished document, but the more of your instructions you share, the more feedback you can get.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Open the word processor document where you are working on your Instructions. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Scroll to the top of the document, placing your cursor at the beginning.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Add a few blank lines with the ENTER key.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Insert a page break, so that the text of your Instructions begins on the next page. 
  <ul class="null">
    <li>CTRL + ENTER usually creates a page break.</li>
    <li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-a-page-break-in-word-eb0e569c-8e3f-4db4-9b13-7bfe1cabdbd7" target="_blank">Insert a page break in Word</a> (Microsoft documentation)</li>
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/45893?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop&hl=en" target="_blank">Work with links, bookmarks, section breaks, or page breaks</a> (Google documentation)</li>
  </ul> </li>
  <li>Scroll back to the top of the document, the beginning of the blank page.</li>
  <li>Write a cover letter (one page or less) that includes the following information:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Greet your reader—you won’t know the names of the people, so use a general greeting.</li>
      <li>Tell your reader any general information that you want them to know about your text.</li>
      <li>Answer at least three of the following questions, copying them into your cover letter and then answering them: 
          <div class="maroonbox" style="width: 330px;float: right;margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px;padding: 6px;">            <strong>TIP:</strong> 
          Make your questions and answers easy for the peer reviewer to find. Make the question bold, and then answer it in plain text.
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>What is your favorite part of this draft, and why?</li>
            <li>What did you find difficult about this draft, and why? </li>
            <li>What part of this draft demonstrates your very best work, and why?</li>

          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Add any final thought in a last paragraph, and close your letter.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Check your cover letter and revise if it is longer than one page long. This is only the length of the cover letter. The Instructions draft can be longer.</li>
  <li>Use a new filename to save your draft for peer review, since you do not need the cover letter in your working draft.  </li>
  <li>Upload your outline with the cover letter to this discussion for feedback.</li>
</ol>
