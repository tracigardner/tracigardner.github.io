    <h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
    <p>Create a first draft of your instructions, which outlines the process that will be followed to collect primary research data for your recommendation report. Your instructions should tell the reader everything necessary to gather data, from the beginning to the end of the process. You will incorporate your instructions into your recommendation report later in the term.</p>
    <h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
    <p>There are four reasons for completing this assignment: </p>

    <ol class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">No matter what your career, you will write instructions for others on your team. Learning more about the genre will help you do your best in those situations.</li>
      <li class="skipline">Your primary research needs to be accurate and uniform. You need to follow the same process when you begin your research as you do when you finish. Having written instructions ensures that you follow one protocol throughout the research process.</li>
      <li class="skipline">Your research process should be reproducible. Another researcher should be able to duplicate your work, and having explicit details on the process you follow will make it possible.</li>
      <li class="skipline">Your work on this Instructions assignment folds directly into your recommendation report. Your instructions outline the primary data you gather and the methods you will use to gather that data. That information will be discussed in the Research Methods and Findings section of your recommendation report, and the full Instructions document will be included in your report appendices. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How You Do It</h3>
    <ol class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">Review the information in Markel and Selber, Chapter 6 in the &ldquo;Conducting Primary Research&rdquo; section (beginning on p. 131) and the decisions you made when you completed the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/assignments/1079584" target="_blank">Making a Primary Research Plan</a> activity.</li>
      <li class="skipline"> Decide on the format and medium for your instructions. You are free to use any medium will clearly explain what a person following the instructions should do. Here are some examples:
        <table class="alternateTable">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th class="alternateTable" scope="col">Medium</th>
              <th class="alternateTable" scope="col">Related Advice</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="alternateTable">Video Instructions</td>
              <td class="alternateTable">See the “Understanding the Role of Instructional Videos” section of Markel &amp; Selber, starting on page 558.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="alternateTable">Written Instructions with related illustrations, formatted for standard 8.5&quot; by 11&quot; paper </td>
              <td class="alternateTable">See the “Designing a Set of Written Instructions” section of Markel &amp; Selber, starting on page 560.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="alternateTable">Numbered panes with limited text, similar to IKEA instructions</td>
              <td class="alternateTable">See “<a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/customer-service/product-support/assembly-guides/" target="_blank">Assembly instructions</a>” on the IKEA website for examples. Note that if your instructions include a task such as asking someone to complete a questionnaire, you will have to incorporate more text than is typical in IKEA-style instructions.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Written Instructions with extensive graphic elements, similar to a poster or infographic</td>
              <td>See the “Designing a Set of Written Instructions” section of Markel &amp; Selber, starting on page 560, as you compose the text. Pay attention to Markel &amp; Selber Chapter 12, “Creating Graphics,” as you design the layout and graphical elements..</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li class="skipline">Create a first draft of your instructions document that outlines exactly how to conduct your primary research and record your data. As you did with your pitch, you get to choose what your first version looks like. Here are some examples:
        <ul class="null">
          <li class="null">Shoot some video footage of yourself or someone else completing your primary research task.</li>
          <li class="null">Write a script for your instructional video.</li>
          <li class="null">Take photos to illustrate your instructions.</li>
          <li class="null">Sketch out an outline for your written instructions and begin filling in the details.</li>
          <li class="null">Create a storyboard for the different panes of your IKEA-style instructions.</li>
          <li class="null">Choose an infographic tool (like Adobe Spark) and begin designing your instructions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Share your some portion of your first version (all of it or just part of it, whatever will help you most) in this week&rsquo;s Discussion in Canvas, following the instructions in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/discussion_topics/1028268" target="_blank">Instructions Draft Feedback Discussion</a>. Aim to post your draft by Thursday so that others in your group have time to provide feedback.</li>
      <li>Submit evidence of your work on your first version to this assignment. You can decide what to submit, based on what you worked on. Here are some examples of what you can submit:
        <ul class="null">
          <li class="null">Video footage you created.</li>
          <li class="null">Images (such as photographs) that you created or shot.</li>
          <li class="null">Your storyboard or outline.</li>
          <li class="null">Your script (or a portion of your script).</li>
          <li class="null">A written explanation of what you did this week.</li>
          <li class="null">Some other kind of evidence that will show your work.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
