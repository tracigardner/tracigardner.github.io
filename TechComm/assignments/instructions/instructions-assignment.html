<p>Create your instructions, which outline the process that will be followed to collect primary research data for your recommendation report. Your instructions should tell the reader everything necessary to gather data, from the beginning to the end of the process. You will incorporate your instructions into your recommendation report as an Appendix.</p>
<h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
<p>There are four reasons for completing this assignment: </p>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">No matter what your career, you will write instructions for others on your team. Learning more about the genre will help you do your best in those situations.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Your primary research needs to be accurate and uniform. You need to follow the same process when you begin your research as you do when you finish. Having written instructions ensures that you follow one protocol throughout the research process.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Your research process should be reproducible. Another researcher should be able to duplicate your work, and having explicit details on the process you follow will make it possible.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Your work on this Instructions assignment folds directly into your recommendation report. Your instructions outline the primary data you gather and the methods you will use to gather that data. That information will be discussed in the Research Methods and the Results sections of your recommendation report, and the full Instructions document will be included in your report appendices. </li>
  </ol>

  </ul>
<h2>When to Do It</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li><strong>Suggested Due Date: </strong>Finish your Instructions by 11:59 PM on Friday, June 4, 2021 to submit for  feedback from me and your classmates.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Chance Date:</strong> The grace period for your work ends at 11:59 PM on Thursday, July 1.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How You Do It</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Create a  Draft</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Review the information in Markel and Selber, Chapter 6 in the &ldquo;Conducting Primary Research&rdquo; section (beginning on p. 135) and the decisions you made when you completed the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/quizzes/289658" target="_blank">Making a Primary Research Plan</a> activity.</li>
  <li class="skipline">    Decide on the format and medium for your instructions. You can use any medium that will clearly explain what a person following the instructions should do. Here are some examples:    
    <table class="alternateTable">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th class="alternateTable" scope="col">Medium</th>
          <th class="alternateTable" scope="col">Related Advice</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="alternateTable">Video Instructions</td>
          <td class="alternateTable">See the “Understanding the Role of Instructional Videos” section of Markel &amp; Selber, starting on page 574.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="alternateTable">Written Instructions with related illustrations, formatted for  standard 8.5&quot; by 11&quot; paper </td>
          <td class="alternateTable">See the “Designing a Set of Written Instructions” section of Markel &amp; Selber, starting on page 575.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="alternateTable">Numbered panes with limited text, similar to IKEA instructions</td>
          <td class="alternateTable">See “<a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/assembly_instructions/billy-bookcase-white__AA-1844854-6_pub.pdf" target="_blank">Billy Bookcase Assembly instructions</a>” on the IKEA website for an example. Note that if your instructions include a task such as asking someone to complete a questionnaire, you will have to incorporate more text than is typical in IKEA-style instructions.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Written Instructions with extensive graphic elements, similar to a poster or infographic</td>
          <td>See the “Designing a Set of Written Instructions” section of Markel &amp; Selber, starting on page 575, as you compose the text. Pay attention to Markel &amp; Selber Chapter 12, “Creating Graphics,” as you design the layout and graphical elements..</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
</li>
  <li class="skipline">Create a draft of your instructions  that outlines  how to conduct your primary research and record your data, from the beginning to the end of the process.</li>
  </ol>
<h3>Step 2: Complete Activities to Improve Your Instructions</h3>
<p>The following activities will all contribute to your Instructions directly or to your Recommendation Report. You can complete all of these activities, or you can pick and choose—just be sure that you put in your best work and record what you do in your work log.</p>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li>Test your Instructions by following them exactly as written or asking a friend to follow them. Note any place where the instructions are confusing or don’t work. Once your test is complete, revise your instructions to update the places that you noted.</li>
  <li>Complete the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/quizzes/289638" target="_blank">Instructions Self-Check</a> to compare the features of your draft to the requirements listed on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/instructions-project-criteria" target="_blank">Instructions Project Criteria</a> page. You can complete this self-check as many times as you like.</li>
  <li>Share your first draft (or as much of a draft as you have) in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/discussion_topics/1090710" target="_blank">Instructions Feedback Discussion</a> in Canvas, following the instructions in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/discussion_topics/1028268" target="_blank"> Draft Feedback Discussion</a>. Next week, use the feedback you receive to revise your work.</li>
  <li>If you missed the original chance for feedback, you can try the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/discussion_topics/1090716" target="_blank">Second-Chance Instructions Feedback Discussion</a> in Canvas.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 3: Submit Your Instructions</h3>
<p>Once you have revised your instructions and have a strong version, submit your instructions to the Instructions Best Draft Assignment. You will add your Instructions to your Appendix next week.</p>
<h2>How to Assess and Track Your Work</h2>
<p>You track and grade your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>Track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
  <li>Check for peer review feedback from your classmates using the instructions from Canvas, <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/Where-can-I-find-my-peers-feedback-for-peer-reviewed-assignments/ta-p/320" target="_blank">Where can I find my peers’ feedback for peer reviewed assignments?</a></li>
  <li>Watch for feedback comments from me:
    <ul>
      <li>Find <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-annotation-feedback-comments-from-my-instructor/ta-p/523" target="_blank">feedback in annotations</a> and <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-assignment-comments-from-my-instructor/ta-p/283" target="_blank">comments</a> on your submissions in Canvas.</li>
      <li> Check Announcements for feedback to the whole class. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Watch for this assignment to reappear in <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-To-Do-list-and-sidebar-in-the-Dashboard-as-a/ta-p/511" target="_blank">your to-do list</a> if I suggest you revise. </li>
