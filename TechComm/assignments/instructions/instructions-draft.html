<h2>Goals</h2>

<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Create a first draft of your instructions, which outlines the process that will be followed to collect primary research data for your recommendation report. Your instructions should tell the reader everything necessary to gather data, from the beginning to the end of the process. You will incorporate your instructions into your recommendation report later in the term.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>There are three reasons for completing this assignment: </p>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">No matter what your career, you will write instructions for others on your team. Learning more about the genre will help you do your best in those situations.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Your primary research needs to be accurate and uniform. You need to follow the same process when you begin your research as you do when you finish. Having written instructions ensures that you follow one protocol throughout the research process.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Your research process should be reproducible. Another researcher should be able to duplicate your work, and having explicit details on the process you follow will make it possible.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Review the information in Markel and Selber, Chapter 6 in the &ldquo;Conducting Primary Research&rdquo; section (beginning on p. 131) and the decisions you made when you completed the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/assignments/1079584" target="_blank">Making a Primary Research Plan</a> activity.</li>
  <li class="skipline">    Decide on the format and medium for your instructions. You are free to use any medium will clearly explain what a person following the instructions should do. Here are some examples:    
    <table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="6" class="alternateTable">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th width="20%" scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
          <th width="80%" scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="alternateTable">Video Instructions</td>
          <td class="alternateTable">See the “Understanding the Role of Instructional Videos” section of Markel &amp; Selber, starting on page 558.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="alternateTable">Written Instructions with related illustrations, formatted for  standard 8.5&quot; by 11&quot; paper </td>
          <td class="alternateTable">See the “Designing a Set of Written Instructions” section of Markel &amp; Selber, starting on page 560.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="alternateTable">Numbered panes with limited text, similar to IKEA instructions</td>
          <td class="alternateTable">See “<a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/customer-service/product-support/assembly-guides/" target="_blank">Assembly instructions</a>” on the IKEA website for examples. Note that if your instructions include a task such as asking someone to complete a questionnaire, you will have to incorporate some text.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
</li>
  <li class="skipline">drama</li>

    <li class="skipline">
      <p>Write an instructions document that outlines exactly how to conduct your primary research and record your data. </p>

  <li class="skipline">Share your some portion of your first version (all of it or just part of it, whatever will help you most) in this week&rsquo;s  Discussion in Canvas, following the instructions for the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/discussion_topics/1010096" target="_blank">Pitch Draft Feedback  Discussion</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Aim to post your draft by Wednesday so that others in your group have time to provide feedback.</li>
    </ul>
  </li> 
  <li class="skipline">Take the feedback from your group into account as you revise your work for submission next week. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Submit evidence of your work on your first version. You can decide what to submit, based on what you worked on. Here are some examples of what you can submit:
    <ul class="null">
      <li class="null">Video footage you created.</li>
      <li class="null">Images (such as photographs) that you created or shot.</li>

      <li class="null">Some other kind of evidence that will show your work.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Use the instructions to guide your primary research, following the instructions as you collect your data. Primary data you gather and the methods you used to gather that data will be discussed in the Research Methods and Findings section of your report. Include the full Instructions document in the report appendices. </li>
