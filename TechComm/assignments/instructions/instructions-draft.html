<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Create a first draft of your instructions, which outline the process that will be followed to collect primary research data for your recommendation report. Your instructions should tell the reader everything necessary to gather data, from the beginning to the end of the process.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>The instructions project supports the research that you will do for your recommendation report. You need to gather two kinds of research for your recommendation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>primary research, which is information  you collect, such as observations and surveys, and</li>
  <li>secondary research, which is information other people have  collected, such as books are articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Markel and Selber’s Chapter 6 (“Researching Your Subject”) discusses these two types of sources in detail. You will conduct your secondary research as you normally would, searching for outside books, articles, and other sources that will support your project.</p>
<p>Your instructions project relates directly to the primary research you will conduct. The instructions you write are critical to ensuring that your primary research is accurate and uniform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primary data you gather and the methods you used to gather that data will be discussed in the Research Methods and Findings section of your report. Include the full Instructions document in the report appendices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Read the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/pitch-presentation-overview" target="_blank">Pitch Presentation Overview</a>, which explains the recommendation report assignment and the requirements that will influence your choice.</li>
  <li class="skipline">
    <p> You will follow these general steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Decide on the kind(s) of primary research that will demonstrate the situation you are examining and its impact. </li>
      <li>Write an instructions document that outlines exactly how to conduct and record your data. </li>
      <li>Use the instructions to guide your primary research, following the instructions as you collect your data.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  </ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Decide how you want to pitch your project. Do you want to
    <ul class="null">
      <li class="null">include some slides? </li>
      <li class="null">explain your plan without extra presentation tools?</li>
      <li class="null">pitch your project with relevant images in the background?</li>
      <li class="null">use a voiceover with video footage illustrating the problem?</li>
      </ul>
    You can choose any of those options or make up something else that is relevant.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Decide what you want to do for your first version/draft of the pitch. You know what you are best at and what you need to work on, so you have the freedom to choose what will help you the most. Here are some examples:
    <ul class="null">
      <li class="null">Shoot some background footage that illustrates the problem you are addressing.</li>
      <li class="null">Write your script, following the advice in “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/checkpoint/enterprise/login/57888345?pathWildcard=57888345&application=learning&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fteaching-future-ready-students%2Fthe-elevator-pitch?u=57888345" target="_blank">The Elevator Pitch</a>” video.</li>
      <li class="null">Choose the tool you want to use (for example, PowerPoint with voiceover, Zoom, a cell phone app) and make a practice video.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Share your some portion of your first version (all of it or just part of it, whatever will help you most) in this week&rsquo;s  Discussion in Canvas, following the instructions for the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/discussion_topics/1010096" target="_blank">Pitch Draft Feedback  Discussion</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Aim to post your draft by Wednesday so that others in your group have time to provide feedback.</li>
      </ul>
  </li> 
  <li class="skipline">Take the feedback from your group into account as you revise your work for submission next week. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Submit evidence of your work on your first version. You can decide what to submit, based on what you worked on. Here are some examples of what you can submit:
    <ul class="null">
      <li class="null">Video footage you created.</li>
      <li class="null">Images (such as photographs) that you created or shot.</li>
      <li class="null">Your script (or a portion of your script).</li>
      <li class="null">A written explanation of what you did this week.</li>
      <li class="null">Some other kind of evidence that will show your work.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
