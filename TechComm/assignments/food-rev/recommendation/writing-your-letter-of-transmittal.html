<p>Introduce your Recommendation Report to its primary readers. The front matter for your report may feel repetitive, but the items in the front matter have different audiences. In your letter of transmittal, focus on the big picture so that the decisionmakers have all the basic information needed to determine whether to read the full report.</p>
<h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>

        <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Focus on Audience</h4>
        <p>Frame the information in your letter of transmittal for the readers who can decide whether to implement your recommendations. Address the decisionmakers directly in the letter, and provide them with the details they need to decide whether to read more of the report. You are giving the decisionmakers a fast summary of the report, focusing on issues that they care about.</p>

  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">The details on the Letter of Transmittal, from p. 495:<br>
        “In the letter of transmittal, which can take the form of a letter or a memo, the writer introduces the primary reader to the purpose and content of the report. In addition, the writer often states who authorized or commissioned the report and acknowledges any assistance he or she received in carrying out the project. The letter of transmittal is attached to the report, bound in with it, or simply placed on top of it. Even though the letter likely contains little information that is not included elsewhere in the report, it is important because it is the first thing the reader sees. It establishes a courteous and professional tone. Letters of transmittal are customary even when the writer and the reader both work for the same organization.”</li>

<h2>How You Do It</h2>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Complete a draft of the body sections of your report (<a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/151634/pages/writing-your-introduction" target="_blank">Introduction</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/151634/pages/writing-your-methods-section" target="_blank">Methods</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/151634/pages/writing-your-results-section" target="_blank">Results</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/151634/pages/writing-your-conclusions-section" target="_blank">Conclusions</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/151634/pages/writing-your-recommendations-section" target="_blank">Recommendations</a>) before beginning your Letter of Transmittal. It’s easier to summarize the report if you have already written it.</li>

        <h4><strong>Tips for Writing Strong Paragraphs</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Begin your paragraphs with a topic sentence that previews the information in the paragraph. See “The Topic Sentence,” on pp. 207–209 of the textbook.</li>
        <li>Use the sections on “The Supporting Information” and “Use Coherence Devices within and between Paragraphs” as you structure your paragraphs. See pp. 209–214 in the textbook.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <li class="skipline">Decide whether you want to write a letter or a memo. Letters and memos have different formats. You can choose either, but be sure that you follow the format for the one you decide on. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Add the appropriate document headers for the type of correspondence you choose. If you include a subject line, include a specific subject line that tells readers exactly what to expect. See the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/151634/pages/strong-subject-lines" target="_blank">Strong Subject Lines</a> page for help.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Do not indicate the name of the assignment or course information anywhere in the Letter of Transmittal.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Write the body of your Letter of Transmittal, following this advice:
    <dl>
      <dt>Paragraph 1</dt>
      <dd>Begin with a clear statement of the purpose and context for the report. Mention the title of the report specifically. For an example, see the first paragraph of the Letter of Transmittal included in the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 504.</dd>
      <dt>Paragraph 2</dt>
      <dd>Briefly summarize the methods used for research. See the second paragraph of the Letter of Transmittal included in the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 504.</dd>
      <dt>Paragraph 3</dt>
      <dd>Explain the principal findings of your research in the next paragraph of your Letter of Transmittal. See the third paragraph of the Letter of Transmittal included in the Sample Recommendation Report on pp. 504–505 for an example.</dd>
      <dt>Paragraph 4</dt>
      <dd>Clearly state your primary recommendation. See the fourth paragraph of the Letter of Transmittal included in the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 505 for an example.</dd>
      <dt>Paragraph 5</dt>
      <dd>Conclude with an offer to follow-up or to provide more information. Include your contact details. See the final paragraph of the of the Letter of Transmittal included in the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 505 for an example.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">If you have chosen the letter format, add a closing and your signature block as well as any other required information. If you have chosen a memo, there is no closing or signature. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Review your Letter of Transmittal to make sure it makes a good  first impression.  Remember that it is the first thing someone who reads the report will see.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Move on to the next part of your report that you want to work on.   </li>
