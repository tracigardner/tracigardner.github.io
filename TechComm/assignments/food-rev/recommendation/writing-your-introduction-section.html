    <p>The Introduction provides an overview of the report that follows. It contains context, background, and forecasts the conclusions and recommendations. </p>
    <p>While the Introduction is the first part of the report’s body, you may want to write the Introduction after you complete the other four parts of the body. It’s easier to summarize your report after you’ve written it.</p>
    <h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
        <ul class="skipline">
          <li class="skipline">The details on the Introduction Section, from p. 493:<br>
            “The introduction helps readers understand the technical discussion that follows.”</li>
          <li class="skipline">The list of nine questions to answer in your Introduction, on p. 493.</li>
          <li class="skipline">Example Introduction Section, on pp. 510–511 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
        </ul>

    </ul>
    <h2>How You Do It</h2>
    <ol class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">Gather ideas for your Introduction by answering the nine brainstorming questions on p. 493 of the textbook. You can <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/brainstorming-your-intro" target="_blank">download the PDF of the questions</a>.</li>
      <li class="skipline">Add the heading for your Introduction:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Add the word <em>Introduction</em> as the heading at the top of the page and center the line. </li>
          <li>Format the word so that it is clearly the heading for the page. You can use the built-in headings in your word processor. See the Tech Tip on p. 55 for help.</li>
          <li>Skip a blank line.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="skipline">Write the content for the Introduction:
        <dl>
          <dt>Paragraph 1</dt>
          <dd>Begin with a clear statement of the purpose and context for the report. Use your answers to the first two brainstorming questions to help with this first paragraph. For an example, see the first paragraph in the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 510. </dd>
          <dt>Paragraph 2</dt>
          <dd>Provide background on your study, using your answer to the third brainstorming question. See the second paragraph of the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 510 of the textbook for help.</dd>
          <dt>Paragraph 3</dt>
          <dd>Describe the tasks you have focused on in your study and connect the tasks to your research methods. Use your answer to the fourth brainstorming question for details. Begin your paragraph with a formal statement of the task you have focused on for your research. Add a bulleted list of the tasks you completed as you explored your topic. Refer to the research methods that you used as you list the tasks.
            See the third paragraph and bulleted list of the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 510 for an example. See Guidelines: Creating Effective Lists on pp. 205–206 for additional help.</dd>
          <dt>Paragraphs 4 & 5</dt>
          <dd>Explain the principal findings of your research in the next two paragraphs of your Introduction. Use your answer to the sixth brainstorming question for details. See the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the Sample Recommendation Report on pp. 510–511 for an example.</dd>
          <dt>Paragraph 6</dt>
          <dd>Clearly state your primary recommendation at the beginning of the paragraph, and then summarize alternative and/or additional recommendations. Indicate relevant benefits of the recommendations. Your answer to the seventh brainstorming question should include the details you need to include. See the sixth paragraph of the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 511 for an example.</dd>
          <dt>Paragraph 7</dt>
          <dd>Conclude the Introduction with an advance organizer for the remainder of the report. Use your answer to the eigth brainstorming question for the basic information. See the final paragraph of the Sample Recommendation Report on p. 511 for an example.</dd>

          <h4><strong>Writing Clear, Informative Paragraphs</strong></h4>
          <p>As you convert your answers to the nine brainstorming questions into your Introduction, make sure that your introduction flows smoothly. It needs to sound like paragraphs, rather than a series of answers to questions.</p>
          <p>Use these sections from the textbook for help:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the advice in the “Structure Paragraphs Clearly” section, from Chapter 9 of the textbook (pp. 207–212).</li>
            <li>See the strategies in the “Use Coherence Devices within and between Paragraphs” section, from Chapter 9 of the textbook (pp. 212–214).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        Reread your draft and revise your Introduction to make sure you have transitions, full sentences, and clear ideas.
      </li>
      <li>Check your Introduction to make sure that any information you quote from your primary or secondary research is enclosed in quotation marks. </li>
      <li>Add <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/151634/pages/documentation-and-citations-for-your-projects" target="_blank">Documentation and Citations</a> anywhere that you include paraphrased information or quotations from outside sources. </li>
      <li class="skipline">Make sure that you have included everything that answers the question, &ldquo;What is this document about?&rdquo; in your Introduction.</li>
      <li class="skipline">Move on to the next part of your report that you want to work on.</li>
