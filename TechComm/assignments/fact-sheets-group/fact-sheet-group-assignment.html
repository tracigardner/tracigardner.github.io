        <h2>What I Want You to Do</h2>
        <p><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/noun-analysis-1118688-200x200.png" width="200" height="204" alt="A page from a report showing an sticky notes and text, with a yellow pencil beside the paper." style="float:right;margin: 0px 0px 12px 12px;" />You and the members of your group will write a recommendation report that analyzes the usability of a website that a Virginia Tech student would use in the workplace or in the course of their academic work at the university.</p>
        <p>You will include customary sections (e.g., intro, methods, results, conclusions, and recommendations), along with front and back matter. Your report will probably be 10&ndash;15 pages long, including all sections.</p>
        <h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
        <p> You will write longer documents in the workplace, usually with a team of people. This assignment examines the various parts that comprise a long report and asks you to practice formatting and arranging a long document.</p>




        <h2>What I Want You to Do</h2>
        <p>In your assigned group, you will collaboratively create a collection of fact sheets that explain key principles of usability, accessibility, or document design. Your group will choose a single website, and each team member will create one fact sheet using that site as an example. The final collection will include a title page, a table of contents, and a letter of transmittal.</p>

        <p>Each fact sheet should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on one principle (e.g., accessible color contrast, alt text, or heading use)</li>
            <li>Be exactly two pages in length</li>
            <li>Include clear examples from the chosen website</li>
            <li>Use consistent formatting and design across the group’s collection</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
        <p>This assignment helps you apply concepts from technical communication—usability, accessibility, and visual design—in a real-world context. It emphasizes collaborative writing, consistent formatting, and professional tone, while also strengthening your ability to analyze and explain digital communication best practices.</p>

        <p>Your audience will be employees responsible for maintaining the chosen website. Your fact sheets should help them recognize and apply improvements to the site’s design and accessibility.</p>

        <h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://webaim.org/">WebAIM</a> – Accessibility guidelines and color contrast tools</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">W3C WAI</a> – Authoritative guidance on accessibility principles</li>
            <li>Your textbook and course readings on design and accessibility</li>
            <li>Class discussions and feedback from your group members</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Scenario for the Project</h2>
        <p>Your group has been hired as a team of usability and accessibility consultants. A company has asked you to assess their website and create educational materials to help their employees improve it. You’ve been asked to prepare a set of short, easy-to-read fact sheets that explain specific principles, show how they relate to the current site, and offer improvement suggestions.</p>

        <p>Your collection will be read and used by a team of developers, designers, and content writers who need accessible and actionable advice.</p>

        <h2>How You Do It</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>With your group, choose a website that is content-rich and can be analyzed for usability and accessibility.</li>
            <li>Assign one principle to each member (e.g., headings, link text, image alt attributes).</li>
            <li>Design a shared template or layout that all fact sheets will follow.</li>
            <li>Each member creates a two-page fact sheet using examples from the website.</li>
            <li>Work collaboratively to compile the collection with:
                <ul>
                    <li>Letter of transmittal</li>
                    <li>Title page</li>
                    <li>Table of contents</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Submit the final PDF or print-ready collection by the final due date.</li>
        </ol>


        <h2>How to Find Feedback After You Submit Your Work</h2>
        <p>You’ll receive feedback both as a group and individually. I’ll review the overall design consistency, organization, and professional tone of your collection. Individually, I’ll assess your fact sheet’s clarity, content, visual layout, and use of appropriate examples.</p>

        <p>Feedback will be posted in [Canvas/Your LMS] within a week of submission. If you want to meet to discuss your feedback or revise your work, just let me know and we’ll schedule a time.</p>
