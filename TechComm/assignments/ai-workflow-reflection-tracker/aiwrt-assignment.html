    <h1>AI Workflow + Reflection Tracker</h1>

    <h2>What I Want You to Do</h2>
    <p>Each time you use AI in a writing assignment, I want you to complete an <strong>AI Workflow + Reflection Tracker entry</strong>. This short activity helps you document how you used the AI tool, what it produced, and what you thought about that process. You&rsquo;ll attach your tracker as an appendix when you turn in your assignment.</p>

    <h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
    <p>This assignment helps you think critically about how AI tools fit into your writing process. It&rsquo;s not just about what the AI gives you&mdash;it&rsquo;s about what you decide to keep, change, or ignore. This kind of reflection builds your confidence, strengthens your decision-making, and helps you use AI ethically and responsibly in both academic and professional writing.</p>
    <!-- 
    <h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>
    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Check our course examples for sample trackers</li>
        <li>Use in-class demos or AI tool walkthroughs for guidance</li>
        <li>Ask during office hours or post questions in our class discussion space</li>
        <li>If you're unsure how to reflect, start by explaining what surprised you, what you changed, or what felt confusing</li>
    </ul>
-->

    <h2>How to Do It</h2>
    <p>Follow the steps below and submit your tracker along with your final draft:</p>
    <ol class="skipline">
        <li>Write your responses in a document or slide deck (or record audio/video if you prefer)</li>
        <li>Label the file or section clearly: <strong>AI Workflow + Reflection Tracker for [Assignment Name or Activity]</strong>. Here are some examples:
            <ul class="null">
                <li>AI Workflow + Reflection Tracker for Proposal Memo Brainstorming</li>
                <li>AI Workflow + Reflection Tracker for Proposal Self-Check</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Include these details in your tracker:
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li><strong>Tool(s) Used + Purpose:</strong> In 2&ndash;3 sentences, explain which AI tool(s) you used and what you were trying to do (e.g., brainstorming ideas, revising tone, generating headings).</li>
                <li><strong>Example AI Output:</strong> Paste a short excerpt or screenshot of what the AI produced. Highlight something you used, changed, or discarded.</li>
                <li><strong>Your Reflection:</strong> Choose one of the reflection prompts below and respond thoughtfully. If none fit your experience, you can write your own reflection prompt.</li>
                <li><strong>Your AI Chat PDF:</strong> Attach the saved AI output PDF as an appendix.</li>
                <li class="optional"><strong>Optional:</strong> You can submit your tracker in a different format&mdash;like an audio note, short video, or visual map&mdash;if that helps you explain your thinking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Make sure your example output and reflection are specific to your experience</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Example Reflection Prompts</h2>
    <p>To guide your reflection, choose one of these prompts:</p>

    <ul class="skipline">
        <li>What was the muddiest point for AI in this use? In other words, what did the AI <em>not</em> understand about your writing goals or audience?</li>
        <li>How did using AI change your approach to revision?</li>
        <li>Compare your voice to the AI&rsquo;s. What did you keep or change to make it more "you"?</li>
        <li>What surprised or challenged you in the AI&rsquo;s output? Include quotation(s) from your Chat PDF to show me.</li>
        <li>How would you explain your AI use to a future employer or colleague?</li>
        <li>What ethical questions came up while using the tool?</li>
        <li>Imagine designing a better AI for this task. What would it do differently?</li>
        <li>How did this AI interaction shape what you learned from the assignment?</li>
        <li>Would your writing have been better or worse without AI? Why?</li>
        <li>If you and the AI were co-authors, how would you divide credit?</li>
    </ul>
