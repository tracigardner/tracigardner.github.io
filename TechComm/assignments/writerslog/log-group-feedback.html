<p>I have marked all of your writer’s logs for the week of o1/25. The logs are marked either complete (or incomplete if they are missing or didn’t meet the requirements of the assignment). In this Announcement, I&rsquo;ll comment on how you all did and what you can do to improve your projects.</p>
<h2 style="color: #e87722;">General Feedback</h2>
<p>Everyone receives one of the five comments listed in the bulleted list below. I use a phrase expander to make the comments consistent from one person to the next:</p>
<dl>
<dt style="font-weight: 500;">You've done a great job putting in effort on this log. Includes all the required information and demonstrates thorough attention to detail. </dt>
    <dd style="margin-bottom: 12px;">What does it mean? Keep doing what you’re doing. You are on track.</dd>
<dt style="font-weight: 500;">Your log includes all the required information. You could improve by including more details on the work that you have done. Specific information helps make your work in the course more visible. </dt>
  <dd style="margin-bottom: 12px;">What does it mean? Your work is okay, but you could do a better job of recording the work you have done. </dd>
<dt style="font-weight: 500;">Your log includes some useful information, but required information is missing or needs to be more detailed (the summary comments and reflections at the end). Be more specific about the work that you have done. </dt>
  <dd style="margin-bottom: 12px;">What does it mean? You have done some of the work, but you didn’t complete the assignment. In the future, if your work is incomplete, you will need to revise to receive the points for your work. </dd>
<dt style="font-weight: 500;">Your log includes most of the required information. You also need to develop your ideas and include more details on the work that you have done. Specific information helps make your work in the course more visible. </dt>
  <dd style="margin-bottom: 12px;">What does it mean? There isn’t enough information in your log. You need to include more details.
In the future, if your work is does not include adequate details, you will need to revise to receive the points for your work. </dd>
<dt style="font-weight: 500;">Your log has no information. It's just the form. Send me a Canvas Inbox message and let me know what's going on please.</dt>
  <dd style="margin-bottom: 12px;">What does it mean? You submitted a blank form, so you received no credit for your work. You will need to do the work and turn it in to earn the points for the week.</dd>

<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Meet the requirements of the assignment.</strong> Make sure you include all 10 kinds of writing and all 11 columns. Be sure that you pay attention to the difference between columns and rows, explained on<a title="Analysis of Writing in Your Field" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/99222/pages/analysis-of-writing-in-your-field" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/99222/pages/analysis-of-writing-in-your-field" data-api-returntype="Page"> the assignment page</a>.

<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Focus on a clear main point.</strong> Your title should tell the reader enough to know exactly what the document is about. Be sure that you are specific about the kind of career involved.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>asdfsadf</strong>.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Avoid centered text</strong>. Remember that the best design for text is flush left, ragged right. Centered text is harder to read. See <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/document-design/page--centered-text-is-harder-to-read.html">Centered Text Is Harder to Read</a><a title="#FridayFact: Centered Text Is Harder to Read" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/99222/discussion_topics/556924" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/99222/discussion_topics/556924" data-api-returntype="Discussion"></a>.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Work on document design:</strong> Many projects could be improved with more attention to document design.

<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Help from the Writing Center:</strong>&nbsp;As a reminder, anyone can make an appointment with the Writing Center for help with projects for the course. Writing Center tutors can help you strengthen your content as well as work on document design and issues with phrasing, grammar, or punctuation. Appointments are online, so you don’t even have to be in Blacksburg. You can read more about the Writing Center and make an appointment on the&nbsp;<a href="https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Writing Center&rsquo;s webpage</a>.</li>
