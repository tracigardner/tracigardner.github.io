        <p>I have added feedback on all of the Feedback on Survey of Website Writing In Your Field Informal Report submitted by Thursday, October 19. In this post, I&rsquo;ll share details on what to do if you have an Incomplete on the project. I will also comment on your work generally, and suggest what you can do to improve your project if I asked you to revise. </p>
        <h2>If You Have an Incomplete</h2>
        <p>If you have an incomplete marked for your Survey of Website Writing In Your Field Informal Report Assignment, you can still earn a Complete on the project.</p>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li><strong>If the project was marked Incomplete and reassigned<br>
                </strong>Revise your project to improve your work, adding whatever is missing or revising the information to include more (or accurate) details. Resubmit your project, and I will review your work again.</li>
            <li><strong>If you did not submit your work at all</strong><br>
                It is not too late. Turn in your work, and I will give you feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Survey of Website Writing In Your Field Informal Report Assignment has a <strong>grace period that ends at 11:59 PM on Friday, December 1</strong>. You have until the end of the grace period, but completing the work sooner will help ensure that you have time to work on the other assignments in the course. </p>

        <h2>General Feedback</h2>
        <p>I have included comments on everyone&rsquo;s drafts. Use this documentation from Canvas for help finding the notes on your drafts:</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Specific Feedback</h2>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li><strong>Meet the requirements of the assignment.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the Excel template when you complete the assignment.</li>
                    <li>Be sure that you delete the instructions in the template and then fill it out completely.</li>
                    <li>Save your work in Excel and upload your Excel file. Do not convert your work to a PDF, Google Doc, or any other format. Your work should be in Excel.</li>
                    <li>Be sure not to change the formatting of the Excel file. See the information at the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/assignments/1835488" target="_blank">bottom of the assignment page</a> for information on wrapping text and aligning text.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Use memo format in your cover memo.</strong> For help, see the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/correspondence-memo-components?module_item_id=2493419" target="_blank">Correspondence: Memo Components page</a>.</li>

            <li><strong>Include a specific and accurate subject line.</strong> Your subject line should tell the reader enough to know exactly what the document is about. Remember that your project is to create an informal report that surveys four types of website writing in your field. See the page on <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/strong-subject-lines" target="_blank">Strong Subject Lines</a> for more help.</li>

            <li><strong>Use sentences in your memo conclusion.</strong> The conclusion to your cover memo should use complete sentences. It also needs to include contact information so that the reader can follow up if they have questions or feedback. Here are some examples:

                <ul>
                    <li>As always, thanks for reading my report. If you have any questions, please give me a call at 555-555-5555 or email me at hokiebird@vt.edu.</li>
                    <li>For questions pertaining to this project, you can reach me at hokiebird@vt.edu. I look forward to any future discussions or collaborations.</li>
                    <li>Thank you for taking the time to read through my analysis. If
                        you have any further questions about my research, contact me via email at hokiebird@vt.edu.</li>
                    <li>Thank you for taking the time to read my memo. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, you can reach me by email at hokiebird@vt.edu or by phone at (555) 555-5555.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>

            <li><strong>Do not include a salutation or a closing signature.</strong> Memo format does not include either of these elements. The To: header addresses the reader, so there&rsquo;s no need for a &ldquo;Dear Hokiebird&rdquo; opening. Similarly, the From: header tells the reader who the memo is from, so you do not need a &ldquo;Best, The Hokiebird&rdquo; closing.</li>


            <li><strong>Proofread and spellcheck your work.</strong> No workplace wants to send out documents that are full of typos. Review your work to make sure you catch these errors. You can also use spellcheck in Excel to help catch your errors. See <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/check-spelling-in-a-worksheet-185efb8d-ee3f-4511-b7ef-35599c924159" target="_blank">the Excel documentation</a> for help.</li>

            <li><strong>Get help from the Writing Center (optional).</strong> Anyone can visit the Writing Center in the library for help with projects for the course. Writing Center tutors can help you strengthen your content as well as work on document design and other issues. You can read more about the Writing Center and make an appointment on the <a href="https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Writing Center&rsquo;s webpage</a>.</li>
