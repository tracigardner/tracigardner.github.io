        <p>You will examine types of writing produced by those who work in your field by identifying at least four different kinds of technical writing that someone in your prospective career typically writes. You will compose a memo to me, summarizing your findings. Step-by-step instructions and a template are provided.</p>

        <h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
        <p>To write effectively in the workplace, you need to understand the basic rhetorical and ethical expectations involved. Every piece of writing people do as part of their day-to-day tasks in the workplace requires decisions about the purpose, audience, kind of writing, and ethical issues. I want you to find example types of writing and make similar decisions by examining how they work.</p>

        <h2>How You Do It</h2>
        <ol id="howyoudoit" class="skipline">
            <li>Review the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/survey-of-writing-in-your-field-criteria" target="_blank">Survey of Writing in Your Field Criteria</a> to understand the requirements for the project.</li>
            <li>Choose the webpages that you will describe:
                <ul class="null">
                    <li>Pick specific webpages that a professional in your field typically uses while working.</li>
                    <li>Avoid overly general pages, like Google or Office 365.</li>
                    <li>Choose webpages that focus on four <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/resources-for-identifying-types-of-writing" target="_blank">different types (or genres) of writing</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Make a backup of the webpages you choose. Websites can change frequently. By saving a backup, you&rsquo;ll avoid the situation where the page changes while you are drafting. If that happens, the information in your project (the answers you provide) can change. Here are some ways to make a backup:
                <ul id="backup" class="null">
                    <li>Print out the webpage on paper, ensuring all the information on the page prints.</li>
                    <li>Print the webpage and choose to print a PDF, so you&rsquo;ll have a digital backup.</li>
                    <li>Save a backup to the Wayback Machine by <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/" title="Instructions to save a page on the Wayback Machine" target="_blank">following these instructions</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Download the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/files/31955292?wrap=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Survey of Writing Template</a>, which you will use to write your report.</li>

            <li>Set up your informal report as a memo from you (your name) to me (my name).</li>
            <li>Follow the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/correspondence-memo-components" target="_blank">layout for memos</a>.</li>

            <li>Use the structure outlined below to compose your project and shown in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/files/31955292?wrap=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Survey of Writing Template</a> to compose your memo:
                <ul id="memocontentsfull">
                    <li><strong>Introduction:</strong>
                        <ul id="introcontents">
                            <li>Explain the purpose of your project and summarize what you discovered.</li>
                            <li>This can be a single sentence or two sentences.</li>
                            <li>You can even start like this: The purpose of this report is to X. Researching for the report, I discovered Y.</li>

                        <ul id="bodycontents">
                            <li>Your body will consist of 6 sections.</li>
                            <li><strong>Approach</strong>: Identify and discuss the approach you took to finding the information. Did you interview someone? If so, who? Where do they work? What's their job title? How do you know them? If you researched online, where did you find the information? Identify your sources in writing. You don't have to list all of the bibliographical material. Just indicate the source titles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Types of Writing</strong>: In separate sections, <em><strong>each with a heading that identifies the type of writing</strong></em>, summarize the various types of writing you learned about. For each, identify these 5 items in paragraph form:
                                <ul id="writingtypescontents">
                                    <li>genre (what type of writing is it?)</li>
                                    <li>purpose of the type of writing (what is it meant to do?)</li>
                                    <li>traditional audience for it</li>
                                    <li>usual mode of delivery (paper, electronic, etc.)</li>
                                    <li>usual length</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Conclusions</strong> (use this as your heading; note the "S"): End the body section by discussing briefly what you learned about the types of writing you might be producing in the workplace. Do <em>not</em> summarize the webpages themselves.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: End cordially and provide your contact information.</li>
                </ul>
