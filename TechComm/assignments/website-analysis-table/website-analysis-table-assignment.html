        <h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
        <p>Describing an item for someone who is unfamiliar with it requires you to think from someone else‚Äôs perspective. You have to outline exactly what it entails so that your readers understand. Technical descriptions are used frequently in the workplace as specifications and material safety data sheets (MSDS). They are also incorporated into other kinds of technical writing, when the reader needs more details to understand (such as describing an item in a report that recommends which production process yields the best results.</p>

        <p>CONTENT GOES HERE</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 123px;"></p>

        <p>For this assignment, you are tasked with finding out about the types of writing produced by those who work in your field. You have two choices for finding this information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You can interview someone working in your intended field</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>This person can be a friend, a family member, or someone you know through past internships or co-ops.</li>
                    <li>This choice will allow you to ask specialized questions to find the information you need for the assignment.</li>
                    <li>You can interview in person, via Zoom, or via email.</li>
                    <li>If you choose this option, read <a title="Research: Interviews " href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/research-interviews" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/177045/pages/research-interviews" data-api-returntype="Page">Research: Interviews.</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>You can do all of your research online</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>This choice might require you to do additional digging to ensure that you find the info needed for the assignment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This assignment has two parts: (a) a cover memo and (b) a data table. Together, they form the two components of an informal report. You are to use the attached Excel template for your report.</p>
        <p>Your report should include <strong>at least FOUR</strong> types of writing.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2><strong>Parts of the Report</strong></h2>
        <h3><strong>Cover Memo</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The cover memo is located on the <em><strong>first tab of the attached Excel file</strong></em>. (Tabs are at the bottom of the sheet.)</li>
            <li>Write your cover memo AFTER you have created your table.</li>
            <li>Follow this structure:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intro: </strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain the purpose of your project and summarize what you discovered.</li>
                            <li>This can be a single sentence or two sentences.</li>
                            <li>You can even start like this: The purpose of this report is to X. Researching for the report, I discovered Y.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Body:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your body will consist of 6 sections.</li>
                            <li><strong>Approach</strong>: Identify and discuss the approach you took to finding the information. Did you interview someone? If so, who? Where do they work? What's their job title? How do you know them? If you researched online, where did you find the information? Identify your sources in writing. You don't have to list all of the biblio material. Just indicate the source titles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Types of Writing</strong>: In separate sections, <em><strong>each with a heading that identifies the type of writing</strong></em>, summarize the various types of writing you learned about.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conclusions</strong> (use this as your heading; note the "S"): End the body section by discussing briefly what you learned from the project about the types of writing you might be producing in the workplace.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: End cordially and provide your contact information.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Data Table</strong><em><strong></strong></em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The data table is located on the <strong>second tab of the attached Excel template</strong>.</li>
            <li>Although it follows the cover memo, it must be created <strong>first</strong> because the memo is based on information you will have learned to produce the table.</li>
            <li>Your data table will cover these items for each of your writing types:
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing Type (i.e., report, memo, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Purpose</li>
                    <li>Audience</li>
                    <li>Medium (How is it usually delivered?)</li>
                    <li>Length</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Wrapping Text &amp; Aligning Text at the Tops of Cells</strong></h2>
        <p>For this project, I have pre-set widths for all of the columns and wrapped the text in each cell of each column/row. Should your text become "unwrapped" as you are inserting it, please re-wrap it. Click out of the cell, click back inside, and click the text wrap icon.</p>
        <p>I have also pre-set the vertical alignment of each cell at the top. If your material gets reset, please click out of the cell, click back inside, and select the vertical-top icon to move it back to the top.</p>
