        <p>I have added feedback on all of the Feedback on Survey of Website Writing In Your Field Informal Report submitted by 11:59 PM Tuesday, February 18. In this post, I&rsquo;ll share details on what to do if you have an Incomplete on the project. I will also comment on your work generally, and suggest what you can do to improve your project if I asked you to revise. </p>
        <h2>If You Have an Incomplete</h2>
        <p>If you have an incomplete marked for your Survey of Website Writing In Your Field Informal Report Assignment, you can still earn a Complete on the project.</p>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li><strong>If the project was marked Incomplete and reassigned<br>
                </strong>Revise your project to improve your work, adding whatever is missing or revising the information to include more (or accurate) details. Resubmit your project, and I will review your work again.</li>
            <li><strong>If you did not submit your work at all</strong><br>
                You have missed the <abbr title="The firm deadline for submitting early drafts for Major Projects."><em>Checkpoint Deadline</em></abbr>, but you can still submit a <abbr title="A single attempt at submitting Major Projects after missing the Checkpoint Deadline. No revisions are allowed."><em>One-Shot Submission</em></abbr> before the end of the Final Grace Period (Friday, May 2, 2025 at 11:59 PM).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Specific Feedback</h2>
        <ul class="skipline">

            <li><strong>Use the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/files/34563266?wrap=1" target="_blank">Survey of Writing Template</a></strong> (PDF) when you complete the assignment.</li>

            <li><strong>Use the correct document title for your memo.</strong> For help, see the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/correspondence-memo-components?module_item_id=2493419" target="_blank">Correspondence: Memo Components page</a> as well as the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/files/34563266?wrap=1" target="_blank">Survey of Writing Template</a>.</li>

            <li><strong>Include a specific and accurate subject line.</strong> Your subject line should tell the reader enough to know exactly what the document is about. Remember that your project is to create an informal report that surveys four types of website writing in your field. See the page on <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/strong-subject-lines" target="_blank">Strong Subject Lines</a> for more help. Biggest Tip? Be sure to include your field in the subject line.</li>

            <li><strong>Follow the assignment</strong>: your task is to find examples of four different kinds of writing that someone in your career field would write. Be sure that you identify four different webpages in your project.</li>

            <li><strong>Include every section that is listed in <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/survey-of-website-writing-in-your-field-criteria" target="_blank">the project criteria</a></strong>. The sections are required to earn a Complete.</li>

            <li><strong>Proofread and spellcheck your work.</strong> No workplace wants to send out documents that are full of typos. Review your work to make sure you catch these errors.</li>

            <li><strong>Get help from the Writing Center (optional).</strong> Anyone can visit the Writing Center in the library for help with projects for the course. Writing Center tutors can help you strengthen your content as well as work on document design and other issues. You can read more about the Writing Center and make an appointment on the <a href="https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Writing Center&rsquo;s webpage</a>.</li>
