<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Now that you have confirmed that you meet all the requirements for the Pitch Presentation by completing the <strong>Pitch Checkthingie</strong>, you need to upload your finished pitch presentation.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>In the workplace, you should be able to compare your work against a list of specifications to determine if your project is complete. This checklist works in just that way: You must be able to confirm every one of the project criteria in the checklist before you can turn in your work. </p>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Review  the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/pitch-presentation-overview" target="_blank">Pitch Presentation Overview</a>, which explains the recommendation report assignment and the requirements that will influence your choice. The criteria on the checklist come primarily from the Overview.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Review the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/crap-design-principles" target="_blank">CRAP Design Principles</a>, which accounts for one of the criterion on the checklist.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Complete the checklist below, indicating the criteria for the Pitch Presentation that you have met. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Submit your checklist responses and check your points total for the activity:  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you earned full points (24 points) for your checklist responses, move on to Part 2 of the Week Five module and upload your video.</li>
    <li>If you earned fewer than 24 points, revise your Pitch Presentation to meet the criteria that you did not meet (anything you marked “False”). You must be able to confirm all the criteria before you can submit your presentation video. </li>
  </ul>
    <li>Submit your rough draft:
  <ul>
    <li>Submit your rough draft here by 11:59 PM on Friday, January 29.</li>
    <li>If you need more time, submit your rough draft by 11:59 PM on Monday, February 1. </li>
  </ul></li>
  </ol>
<h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li>You will automatically receive the points for your work when you submit this checklist. Canvas checks the work and awards the points. You can complete the checklist as many times as necessary to earn full points.</li>
  <li>Once you earn full points, you MUST submit your project in Part 2 of the Week Five module. </li>
  <li>Once you submit your project video, Traci will review your work:
    <ul>
      <li>If she finds that it does not meet  the requirements for the assignment, she will adjust the points on your checklist and ask you to resubmit.</li>
      <li>If she finds that you did not submit your video, she will adjust the points and ask you to submit it.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, she will give you feedback. Your points will not change.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>
