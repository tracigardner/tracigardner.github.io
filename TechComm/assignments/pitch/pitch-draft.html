<h2>What You Will Learn and Practice</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How to analyze your audience and purpose so that you can choose the best way to present information clearly and effectively.. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 1]</li>
<li>How to write documents you may encounter in the workplace, such as letters, memos, instructions, proposals, reports, and presentations. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 4]</li>

<h2>What I Want You to Do</h2>
<p><img src="../../-images/noun_Elevator_3313957.png" width="270" height="231" alt="Computer screen showing an email message" style="float:right;margin: 0px 0px 12px 12px;" />Create a draft of what you will say in your pitch. Your pitch presentation will tell your decisionmaker about the situation you are exploring, why it needs to change, and recommends the next action to take. Your pitch will take the format of a video recording with audio that outlines the basic details you plan for your recommendation report and persuades listeners to support your plan. </p>
<p>The transcript for your audio can be used as part of your report introduction and front matter. Graphics that you create can be used as illustrations and visuals in your report.</p>
<h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
<p>Your pitch is three minutes or less. You can jumpstart the opening portions of your report by working on a clear, concise statement of your topic and how you will address the situation you are examining. Additionally, you will get practice in persuasive oral presentations, which are a highly useful skill in the workplace.</p>

      <p>The following activities will all contribute to your Instructions and to your Recommendation Report. You can complete all of these activities, or you can pick and choose—just be sure that you put in your best work and record what you do in your work log.</p>

        <li>Share your first draft (or as much of a draft as you have) in the Pitch Script Feedback Discussion in Canvas. Next week, use the feedback you receive to revise your work.</li>
        <li>If you missed the original chance for feedback, you can try the Second-Chance Pitch Script Feedback Discussion in Canvas.</li>
        <li>Next week, move on to work on the slides that you will show as you read your script.      </li>
      </ol>
