<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Create a first version (widely defined) of your pitch presentation. The pitch  requires a video recording with audio that outlines the basic details you plan for your recommendation report and persuades listeners to support your plan.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>Your pitch is very short, 60 seconds or less. Short doesn’t mean easy though. I want you to begin your pitch this week by doing whatever you think you need to get ahead. Sometimes when an assignment is very short, we wait until the last minute to start (believe me, I’ve done it too). Put in the work this week that will allow you to turn in your best work for the final version. </p>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Read the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/pitch-presentation-overview" target="_blank">Pitch Presentation Overview</a>, which explains the recommendation report assignment and the requirements that will influence your choice.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Decide how you want to pitch your project. Do you want to
    <ul class="null">
      <li class="null">include some slides? </li>
      <li class="null">explain your plan without extra presentation tools?</li>
      <li class="null">pitch your project with relevant images in the background?</li>
      <li class="null">use a voiceover with video footage illustrating the problem?</li>
      </ul>
    You can choose any of those options or make up something else that is relevant.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Decide what you want to do for your first version/draft of the pitch. You know what you are best at and what you need to work on, so you have the freedom to choose what will help you the most. Here are some examples:
    <ul class="null">
  <li class="null">Shoot some background footage that illustrates the problem you are addressing.</li>
  <li class="null">Write your script, following the advice in “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/checkpoint/enterprise/login/57888345?pathWildcard=57888345&application=learning&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fteaching-future-ready-students%2Fthe-elevator-pitch?u=57888345" target="_blank">The Elevator Pitch</a>” video.</li>
  <li class="null">Choose the tool you want to use (for example, PowerPoint with voiceover, Zoom, a cell phone app) and make a practice video.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Share your some portion of your first version (all of it or just part of it, whatever will help you most) in this week&rsquo;s  Discussion in Canvas, following the instructions for the <strong>Pitch Draft Feedback  Discussion</strong>.
<ul>
      <li>Aim to post your draft by Wednesday so that others in your group have time to provide feedback.</li>
    </ul>
  </li> 
  <li class="skipline">Take the feedback from your group into account as you revise your work for submission next week. You do not need to turn in your first draft to me.</li>
</ol>
