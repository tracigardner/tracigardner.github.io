<h2>What You Will Learn and Practice</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How to analyze your audience and purpose so that you can choose the best way to present information clearly and effectively.. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 1]</li>
<li>How to write documents you may encounter in the workplace, such as letters, memos, instructions, proposals, reports, and presentations. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 4]</li>
<li>Collaborate with classmates in planning, researching, writing, revising, and presenting information. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 5]</li>

<h2>What I Want You to Do</h2>
<p><img src="../../-images/noun_Elevator_3313957.png" width="270" height="231" alt="Computer screen showing an email message" style="float:right;margin: 0px 0px 12px 12px;" />Create your pitch, which will tell your decisionmaker about the situation you are exploring, why it needs to change, and recommends the next action to take. Your pitch will take the format of a video recording with audio that outlines the basic details you plan for your recommendation report and persuades listeners to support your plan. The transcript for your audio can be used as part of your report introduction and front matter.</p>
<h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
<p>Your pitch is three minutes or less. You can jumpstart the opening portions of your report by working on a clear, concise statement of your topic and how you will address the situation you are examining. Additionally, you will get practice in persuasive oral presentations, which are a highly useful skill in the workplace.</p>

<h2>When to Do It</h2>
<ul class="skipline">

</ul>
<h2>How You Do It</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Compose a  Draft</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Review the information in Markel and Selber, Chapter 6 in the &ldquo;Conducting Primary Research&rdquo; section (pp. 135–147) and the decisions you made when you completed the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/quizzes/299244" target="_blank">Making a Primary Research Plan</a> activity.</li>
        <li class="skipline">Create a draft of your instructions  that outlines  how to conduct your primary research and record your data, from the beginning to the end of the process.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Step 2: Complete Activities to Improve Your Instructions</h3>
      <p>The following activities will all contribute to your Instructions and to your Recommendation Report. You can complete all of these activities, or you can pick and choose—just be sure that you put in your best work and record what you do in your work log.</p>
      <ol class="skipline">
        <li>Test your Instructions by following them exactly as written or asking a friend to follow them. Note any place where the instructions are confusing or don’t work. Once your test is complete, revise your instructions to update the places that you noted.</li>
        <li>Complete the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/assignments/1214881" target="_blank">Instructions Self-Check</a> to compare the features of your draft to the requirements listed on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/pages/instructions-project-criteria" target="_blank">Instructions Project Criteria</a> page. You can complete this self-check as many times as you like.</li>
        <li>Share your first draft (or as much of a draft as you have) in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/discussion_topics/1102610" target="_blank">Instructions Feedback Discussion</a> in Canvas. Next week, use the feedback you receive to revise your work.</li>
        <li>If you missed the original chance for feedback, you can try the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/discussion_topics/1102609" target="_blank">Second-Chance Instructions Feedback Discussion</a> in Canvas.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Step 3: Submit Your Instructions</h3>
      <p>Once you have revised your instructions and have a strong version, submit your instructions to the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/assignments/1214921" target="_blank">Instructions Best Draft Submission</a>. You will add your Instructions to your Appendix later in the term.</p>
      <h2>How to Assess and Track Your Work</h2>
      <p>You track and grade your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
      <ul class="skipline">
        <li>Track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
        <li>Watch for feedback comments from me—find <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-annotation-feedback-comments-from-my-instructor/ta-p/523" target="_blank">feedback in annotations</a> and <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-assignment-comments-from-my-instructor/ta-p/283" target="_blank">comments</a> on your submissions in Canvas. </li>
        <li>Watch for this assignment to reappear in <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-To-Do-list-and-sidebar-in-the-Dashboard-as-a/ta-p/511" target="_blank">your to-do list</a> if you need to revise or choose a new topic.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Work is always marked as either 1 for Complete or 0 for Incomplete:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I will mark  this activity <em>Complete</em> in Canvas Grades, usually within 24–48 hours after the end of the grace period.</li>
        <li>I will mark this activity <em>Incomplete</em> in Canvas Grades if your topic needs revision OR if you do not submit your topic by the end of the grace period.</li>
      </ul>

    <ul class="null">
  <li class="null">Shoot some background footage that illustrates the problem you are addressing.</li>

  <li class="null">Choose the tool you want to use (for example, PowerPoint with voiceover, Zoom, a cell phone app) and make a practice video.</li>
