<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Create a first version (widely defined) of your pitch presentation. The pitch  requires a video recording with audio that outlines the basic details you plan for your recommendation report and persuades listeners to support your plan.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>Your pitch is very short, 60 seconds or less. Short doesn’t mean easy though. I want you to begin your pitch this week by doing whatever you think you need to get ahead. Sometimes when an assignment is very short, we wait until the last minute to start (believe me, I’ve done it too). Put in the work this week that will allow you to turn in your best work for the final version. </p>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Read the <strong>Pitch Presentation Overview</strong>, which explains the recommendation report assignment and the requirements that will influence your choice.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Decide how you want to present your project. Do you want to
    <ul class="null">
      <li class="null">include some slides? </li>
      <li class="null">explain your plan without extra presentation tools?</li>
      <li class="null">pitch your project with relevant images in the background?</li>
      <li class="null">use a voiceover with video footage illustrating the problem?</li>
      </ul>
      You can choose any of those options or make up something else.</li>
    <li class="skipline">Decide what you want to do for your first version of the pitch. You know what you are best at and what you need to work on. </li>  

  <li class="skipline">Jot out a short explanation of your topic:  </li>
  <ul class="skipline">
    <li class="skipline"> Aim for about the length of a Tweet, which is 280 characters. There’s  no problem if you run over.</li>
    <li class="skipline">Make your topic specific. For example, don’t say “an intersection.” Tell us exactly what intersection in what town.</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="skipline">Share your short explanation in this week&rsquo;s  Discussion in Canvas, following the instructions for the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/discussion_topics/1003407" target="_blank">Topic Feedback  Discussion</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Aim to post your explanation by Wednesday so that others in your group have time to provide feedback.</li>
      </ul>
  </li> 
  <li class="skipline">Take the feedback from your group into account, and revise your topic, if necessary.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Answer the questions below to tell me about your topic. This week includes a Spring Break Day, so I have included short targets for your responses. I am not expecting long paragraphs (though if you want to write more, you always can).</li>
  <ul class="skipline">
    <li>Submit your rough draft here by 11:59 PM on Friday, February 12.</li>
    <li>If you need more time, submit your rough draft by the end of the grace period, at 11:59 PM on Monday, February 15. </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
<p>You track and grade your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/126055/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
<li>Post your rough draft in Discussions in Canvas with a specific question, for this week&rsquo;s <span class="skipline"><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/discussion_topics/1003407" target="_blank">Topic Feedback  Discussion</a></span>.</li>
<li>Wait for me to give you points for your answers. Canvas cannot automatically grade written text, so I have to add your points manually. 
  <ul>
    <li>As soon as I confirm that your topic meets the requirements, I will give you full points. </li>
    <li>If something is missing or needs more details, you will have a chance to revise. You will still earn full points, as long as you revise.</li>
  </ul>
