<ul>
  <li>decide on the best way to present your recommendation report topic to the class,</li>
  <li>create a script for the presentation, and</li>
  <li>produce the presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general goal of the project is to learn how to make a short, persuasive oral presentation and to learn about the best strategies for all oral presentations. Ideally, you’ll discover how to avoid causing death by PowerPoint as well.</p>
<h2>What Is a Pitch?</h2>
<p>You are probably familiar with the idea of a pitch. The textbook <em>Writer/Designer</em> (2014) explains the genre this way:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A pitch is a short presentation that explains how the what and the how of your idea might come together in the final project. It&rsquo;s a means of convincing audience members who have some stake in what you are proposing that you know what you&rsquo;re talking about and can take on the project at hand. (Pitches are sometimes called elevator speeches, drawing on the idea of a writer who is on an elevator with a publisher and has only four floors to convince the publisher to accept his or her book proposal.) (p. 55)</p></blockquote>
<p>If you watch the TV show <em>Shark Tank</em>, you have seen lots of pitches. The show is essentially nothing but pitches and the response to them. While you may not have given a workplace pitch, you have probably pitched an idea to a family member or friend, to a teacher or coach, or to another member of your community.</p>
<p>The LinkedIn Learning video “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/checkpoint/enterprise/login/57888345?pathWildcard=57888345&application=learning&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fteaching-future-ready-students%2Fthe-elevator-pitch?u=57888345" target="_blank">The Elevator Pitch</a>” (3m 32s) demonstrates exactly how to compose your pitch. The video is intended for teachers who will have students make a pitch, but you should easily be able to determine the parts that will apply to your project.</p>

<h2>Assignment Details</h2>
<p>Your job in this short presentation is to explain your plans for your recommendation report in a way that persuades your audience to approve of or agree with your plans.</p>
<h3>What to Include</h3>
<p>Your pitch should include this information:</p>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline"><strong>Introduction</strong>: Use the “GUIDELINES: Introducing the Presentation,” on p. 585 of Markel and Selber, to plan your opening. Since you are giving a short presentation, choose the items that seem most important to conveying your plan. You don’t need to follow all five of the suggestions.</li>
    <li class="skipline"><strong>Summary.</strong> Follow the six-point plan from “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/checkpoint/enterprise/login/57888345?pathWildcard=57888345&application=learning&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fteaching-future-ready-students%2Fthe-elevator-pitch?u=57888345" target="_blank">The Elevator Pitch</a>” video.</li>
  <li class="skipline"><strong>Conclusion.&nbsp;</strong>Use the “GUIDELINES: Concluding the Presentation,” on p. 586 of Markel and Selber, to plan your closing. As with the intro, you don’t need to follow all the suggestions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Present</h3>
    <div style="float: right; width: 330px;padding: 9px;border: 3px solid #861f41;background-color: #E5e1e6;font-size: 12pt;">
         <img src="../../-images/noun_Privacy_2631175.png" width="50" height="68" alt="" style="float: left;margin: 0px 12px 45px 0px;"/>Do not feel you need to record your pitch with TikTok or Instagram. Protect your privacy by NOT posting your classwork on your personal social media. </div>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Aim for 60 seconds (the length of a TikTok or an Instagram video)  for your presentation. You can run over a few seconds, but not a few minutes. Remember that this project is a short, elevator pitch. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Record your elevator pitch as a video. Since this is an oral presentation, you must explain your project orally. Note however that you do not have to include yourself in the video. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Choose whatever software/hardware you like, but the finished project must be easily viewable, without a login or special software. Here are some examples you can use:
    <ul class="null">
  <li class="null">PowerPoint presentation of two or three slides with an audio recording, saved as a video.</li>
  <li class="null">Video of yourself, with whatever props or additional footage  desired.</li>
      <li class="null">Video of the situation, with your audio explanation.</li></ul></li>
  <li class="skipline">Be sure your  video and any images or photographs you incorporate  meet the following characteristics:  
    <ul class="null">
  <li class="null">Clear, well-focused, and relevant to the topic. </li>
  <li class="null">Serve a clear purpose (avoid purely decorative images).</li>
  <li class="null">Free of distractions that are not relevant to the topic.</li>
  <li class="null">Directly related to the topic (avoid clipart, which looks less professional).</li>
  <li class="null">Without watermarks or otherwise indications that  the  audio, video, or image belongs to someone else.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If you choose to include some slides, pay close attention to information on “Preparing Presentation Graphics,” on pp. 586–599 of Markel and Selber, as you design your presentation. Most importantly, keep in mind that no one wants to hear you read the slides!</li>
