        <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">You can use the online texts, any notes that you have, and the available course pages in Canvas for help as you work on these questions. You can also talk to one another.</p>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Answer the following questions honestly to let me know how you have done in the course. Please be honest as you assess yourself.</p>
    <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18px !important;font-weight: bold;">How This Activity Connects to the Course</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">This is a Pathways course, which meets the Discourse (Area 1) goals and the Ethical Reasoning integrative goals. This survey will gather your self-assessment and send the information anonymously to the Pathways office. I will also use your responses to improve the course for the Spring Semester.</p>
    <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18px !important;font-weight: bold;">Some Tips on this Check-In Survey</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">There are no right or wrong answers. As long as you fill out this survey, you will earn a Complete for this activity. Beyond that, your responses will not help or hurt you in the course.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Each question includes an example that is formatted in italics after the question. Course Learning Objectives (CLO) use academic jargon that may be confusing. I intend for the examples to give you an idea of what the assessment question is asking about.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">You do not have to have done the exact action listed in the example to &ldquo;Agree&rdquo; or to &ldquo;Strongly Agree.&rdquo; They are just examples. They are not the only examples.</p>
    <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18px !important;font-weight: bold;">Assessment</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">I will assess your participation manually, because Canvas cannot automatically grade this kind of a survey. To earn a Complete, the section you are responsible for must be filled out fully. I will mark your Check-In Survey Complete (or Incomplete) as soon as possible, but definitely by the end of Reading Day (Thursday, December 12).</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Because of the requirements of the Pathways office, there are points values associated with the questions. They are meaningful only to the Pathways office. They do not have any influence on your course grade or your assessment for this Check-In Survey.</p>
