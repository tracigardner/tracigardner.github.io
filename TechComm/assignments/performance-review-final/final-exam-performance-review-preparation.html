<p>Prepare to complete a performance review form by  evaluating your work in the course and proposing the course grade you should receive on the final. Gather information from your&nbsp;Weekly Work Logs, Midterm Progress Report, and completed course activities to support the course grade you propose for yourself.</p>
<h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
<p>You will write performance evaluations in the workplace, both to assess your own work and to assess the work of colleagues. The final exam examines this type of writing while also evaluating your work in this course. The final exam gives you the chance to demonstrate your productivity and accomplishments in the course, using your best persuasive abilities to argue your case for your course grade.</p>

<h2>When to Do It</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li><strong>Firm Due Date:</strong> By 11:59 PM on Wednesday, December 15, 2021, the end of the Fall term.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How You Do It</h2>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Familiarize yourself with the characteristics and features of performance reviews, using resources from the “Where You Can Find Help” section above.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Review your work logs, Midterm Progress Report, and completed course activities to gather your data. You are conducting primary research on your accomplishments in the course this term. You should find much of what you need in your Weekly Work Log. Consider these questions:
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li>What work did you complete  in the course?</li>
      <li>Are there  tasks that you were unable to complete? If so, explain which ones and why you were unable to complete them?</li>
      <li>Which document demonstrates your highest quality work? Why?</li>
      <li>What evidence demonstrates that you invested your best effort in the course?</li>
      <li>How have you supported members of your group in your Feedback Discussions?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Gather the relevant evidence (e.g., links to examples, quotations or other evidence from your work).</li>
  <li>Compare your findings to the course expectations. Once you have gathered your findings about your work in the course, compare them to the expectations for the kinds of work in the course, and conclude how well you did:
    <ul class="null">
      <li>Reading</li>
      <li>Writing</li>
      <li>Discussing</li>
      <li>Tracking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Be sure that you consider your work in the entire course, and if relevant, be honest about where you fell short. You can use tables and charts as appropriate to present your evidence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Use the information you have gathered to complete your final exam. Be sure to submit your exam by 11:59 PM on  Wednesday, December 15, 2021. There is no grace period on the final exam.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Assess &amp; Track Your Work</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>I will read your final, looking for evidence that supports your argument for a specific course grade. Specific details will be most convincing.</li>
    <li>I will record your course grade as the grade for your final. In most cases, I will record the grade you suggest as your course grade. I reserve the right to change your grade as appropriate however. I will add comments if I change your course grade from your proposal.</li>
