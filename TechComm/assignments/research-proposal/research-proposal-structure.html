    <h3>ðŸ’¼ Required Sections for Your Proposal</h3>

    <p>Each section of your proposal has a job to do&mdash;together, they show your readers what you're planning, why it matters, and how you&rsquo;ll get it done. </p>

    <p>Use this guide as you work through each part of the document with your group. For examples and explanations, check out the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/assignments/2273850" target="_blank">Proposal Assignment</a> and the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/pages/annotated-proposal-template" target="_blank">Annotated Proposal Template</a>.</p>
