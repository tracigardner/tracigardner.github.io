    <p>Students often start with topics that are interesting and meaningful&mdash;but a little too broad, too instructional, or aimed at the wrong audience. For the report you are proposing, you&rsquo;re not just explaining a subject. You&rsquo;re writing to a specific, non-expert decision-making group that is evaluating a clear choice.</p>

    <p>The examples below show how you can shift from a general awareness topic to a focused, decision-centered report. Notice how the revised versions make these changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They narrow the audience.</li>
        <li>They define a concrete decision.</li>
        <li>They maintain an objective tone.</li>
    </ul>
