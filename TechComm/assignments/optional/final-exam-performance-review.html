<h2>The Task</h2>
  <p style="border: 3px double #861f41; background-color: #f4f3f5;padding: 6px;">The final exam in this course is <strong>optional</strong>. If you are happy with your current course grade, you need not submit a final. <br /><br />

<p>Write a performance review that evaluates your work in the course and proposes the grade you should receive on the final, using information from your&nbsp;Weekly Work Logs to support your recommendation. In the workplace, this report would be similar to a annual self-evaluation.</p>

<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Familiarize yourself with the characteristics and features of performance reviews, using resources from the “Where You Can Find Help” section above.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Review your work logs and gather your data. You are conducting primary research on your accomplishments in the course this term.  You should find much of what you need in your Weekly Work Log. Consider these questions:
    <ul class="null">
      <li>What have you done to work consistently during the entire term?</li>
      <li>Which document demonstrates your highest quality work? Why?</li>
      <li>What work demonstrates that you invested your best effort in the course?</li>
      <li>How have you supported members of the course in your Feedback Discussions?</li>
      <li>What (if anything) did you do to go beyond the basic requirements of the course?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Gather the relevant evidence (e.g., links to examples, quotations or other evidence from your work).</li>
  <li>Compare your findings to the course expectations. Once you have gathered your findings about your work in the course, compare them to the expectations for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJg9RoMQ31UQRcPeZuLFjGFjG25uosrG5AFw2IeW2c8/edit#heading=h.aoavw076fhnx">kinds of work in the course</a>, and conclude how well you did:
    <ul class="null">
      <li>Reading</li>
      <li>Writing</li>
      <li>Discussing</li>
      <li>Tracking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Be sure that you consider your work in the entire course, and if relevant, be honest about where you fell short. You can use tables and charts as appropriate to present your evidence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Compose your final exam in your word processor. </li>
  <li>Check your work against  these expectations for the final exam. Your performance review should
    <ul>
      <li> Include the following sections and information:
        <ul class="null">
          <li>details on your overall work in the course.</li>
          <li>a comparison of your accomplishments to the course expectations</li>
          <li>a conclusion of the grade you should receive for the course.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Be specific and detailed, since I will go by the information in your report as I determine your final exam grade. If you do not provide adequate, specific details, your grade will be lower.</li>
      <li>Use  layout and design to create a report that is clear and easy to read. If it’s also fun and interesting, that’s great too.</li>
      <li>Specifically state how many points the final exam should add to your course grade (maximum: 40 points). Explain how you arrived at your number.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Review your exam for design and basic writing errors. Everything you write should use appropriate image editing, grammar, spelling, punctuation, mechanics, linking, and formatting. </li>
  <li>Submit your project in Canvas. Upload your completed final in Canvas by 11:59 PM on Wednesday, May 12. There is no grace period for the exam.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>I will read your final, looking for evidence that supports your argument for a specific number of additional points.</li>
    <li>If necessary, I will adjust the number to better represent your work in the course. In such cases, I will add a comment the explains my decision.</li>
