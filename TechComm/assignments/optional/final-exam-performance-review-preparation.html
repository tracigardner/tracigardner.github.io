    <p>Prepare to complete a performance review form by evaluating your work in the course and proposing the grade you should receive on the final. Gather information from your&nbsp;Weekly Work Logs and completed course activities to support the grade you recommend for the final.</p>
    <h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
    <p>You will write performance evaluations in the workplace, both to assess your own work and to assess the work of colleagues. The final exam gives you the chance to learn about this type of writing while also evaluating your work in this course. The final exam gives you the chance to demonstrate your productivity and accomplishments in the course, using your best persuasive abilities to argue your case.</p>

    <h3>How You Do It</h3>
    <ol class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">Familiarize yourself with the characteristics and features of performance reviews, using resources from the “Where You Can Find Help” section above.</li>
      <li class="skipline">Review your work logs and gather your data. You are conducting primary research on your accomplishments in the course this term. You should find much of what you need in your Weekly Work Log. Consider these questions:
        <ul class="null">
          <li>What have you done to work consistently during the entire term?</li>
          <li>Which document demonstrates your highest quality work? Why?</li>
          <li>What work demonstrates that you invested your best effort in the course?</li>
          <li>How have you supported members of your group in your Feedback Discussions?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Gather the relevant evidence (e.g., links to examples, quotations or other evidence from your work).</li>
      <li>Compare your findings to the course expectations. Once you have gathered your findings about your work in the course, compare them to the expectations for the kinds of work in the course, and conclude how well you did:
        <ul class="null">
          <li>Reading</li>
          <li>Writing</li>
          <li>Discussing</li>
          <li>Tracking</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Be sure that you consider your work in the entire course, and if relevant, be honest about where you fell short. You can use tables and charts as appropriate to present your evidence.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Use this information you have gathered to complete your final exam when it opens, at 12:00 AM (midnight) on Friday, May 7. Be sure to submit your exam by 11:59 PM on Wednesday, May 12. There is no grace period on the final exam.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li>I will read your final, looking for evidence that supports your argument for a specific number of additional points.</li>
      <li>If necessary, I will adjust the number to better represent your work in the course.</li>
    </ul>
