    <p>Here are answers to questions I have received related to the optional activities in the course.</p>

    <dl class="skipline">
      <dt>Where are the optional points explained?</dt>
      <dd>The points system is explained in the Course Manual. See the information on “<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJg9RoMQ31UQRcPeZuLFjGFjG25uosrG5AFw2IeW2c8/edit#heading=h.mwvsuczj5o5" target="_blank">Additional, Optional Points in the Course</a>.” You can find more recent details on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/optional-activities-overview" target="_blank" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/132039/pages/optional-activities-overview" data-api-returntype="Page">Optional Activities Overview</a> page.</dd>
      <dt>Where do I find the optional reading activities?</dt>
      <dd>Optional readings have been posted every class day (excluding Mondays and Spring Break Days) since February 2. Links to these readings appear under the &ldquo;Canvas Announcements &amp; Course Advice&rdquo; heading on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039" target="_blank">Course Home page</a>. These posts are also referred to in the weekly Updates Announcements that are posted every Monday and in the Module Instructions for each week.</dd>
      <dt>Are there additional details on how the Optional Reading Activities work?</dt>
      <dd>Yes, read the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/optional-reading-activities-instructions" target="_blank" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/132039/pages/optional-reading-activities-instructions" data-api-returntype="Page">Optional Reading Activities Instructions</a>.</dd>
      <dt>I missed some of the optional readings for February? Is every activity required to earn an A?</dt>
      <dd>No, you can do some basic math to figure out what is required. The weekly modules guarantee you a B, or 830 points, if you do all the work. An A requires 930 points or more, and there are 170 optional points in total. Math: 930 -830 = 100 optional points needed. Since there are 170 optional points available, there are 70 more points than you need for an A.</dd>
      <dt>What optional activities can be completed?</dt>
      <dd>These are the activities that will be available and the total number of points for each category:
        <ul>
          <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/modules/items/1344307" target="_blank">Reading optional posts</a>, which frequently include watching LinkedIn Learning videos.<br>
            Each post is worth 1 point, and the optional reading activities are worth up to 50 points total.</li>
          <li aria-level="1">Writing additional short documents.<br>
            Each of eight, short documents is worth up to 10 points each. These optional writing activities are worth up to 80 points total.</li>
          <li aria-level="1">Completing the final exam.<br>
            The optional final exam focuses on writing a performance review. The final exam is worth up to 40 points total.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can complete any combination of optional activities to earn additional points. A point is worth the same amount no matter how you earn it.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>When will additional activities be available?</dt>
      <dd>This week (the week of March 8) I have begun posting information on additional course activities that you can complete if you set a goal to earn a grade higher than a B in the courses. During a normal term, details on these additional activities are posted after Spring Break. Since this term we have no Spring Break, I will begin posting them this week (which would probably have been Spring Break if there were no pandemic).<br /><br />
        Additional activities will be mentioned in the Module Instructions each week. You can also watch for Announcements that will let you know when additional activities have been posted.</dd>
