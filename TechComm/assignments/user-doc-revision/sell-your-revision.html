                <p>You may have had a teacher who talked about <strong style="color: #861f41;">&ldquo;showing, not telling&rdquo;</strong> in your writing. The idea is pretty straightforward. It&rsquo;s exactly what it says: Show the reader whatever you are exploring. Don&rsquo;t just tell them about it. Make it vivid and visual. Leave the reader with a clear understanding of exactly what you are discussing.</p>
            </div>

                <p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen this strategy at work your entire life. Take look at Figure 1, before and after images of a pair of shoes. The first shoe has brown stains, and the second shoe is bright white and clean.</p>
                <p>This before and after image is used <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/OxiClean-5-lbs-White-Revive-Powder-Fabric-Stain-Remover-51652/205689798?MERCH=REC-_-pip_alternatives-_-317245582-_-205689798-_-N#overlay" target="_blank">on the HomeDepot website</a> to sell OxiClean. The marketing strategy <strong style="color: #861f41;">shows</strong> the reader what the product can do. &ldquo;Just look at the difference between these two shoes,&rdquo; it yells. &ldquo;You could have these results too! Just buy OxiClean!&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Consider the alternative in Figure 2. The marketing image is bright and <strong style="color: #861f41;">shows</strong> what a Tide Pod looks like, but that&rsquo;s as far as it goes. The rest of the image focuses on <strong style="color: #861f41;">telling</strong> the reader about the Pod&rsquo;s &ldquo;3 in 1&rdquo; features:</p>

                <ul style="margin-left: 24px;list-style-image: url('../../-images/noun-checkmark-7426487-861F41-24px.png');">
                    <li>Concentrated detergent</li>
                    <li>Stain removers</li>
                    <li>Color protector</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Unlike the OxiClean image, the Tide image includes nothing to <strong style="color: #861f41;">show</strong> the reader how effective it is at removing stains or protecting colors.</p>

    <p>This example uses a photo, but you can <strong style="color: #861f41;">show</strong> without images. Consider how background music helps show the tone and situation in a commercial. Think about how visually descriptive language is stronger than alternatives. For the image of shoes, a description could say that the shoe on the left is dirty, OR it could say</p>

    <p>Which is more persuasive? Being <strong style="color: #861f41;">told</strong> about what OxiClean can do, or being <strong style="color: #861f41;">shown</strong> what it can do? Most sighted people would say being shown in this example. Showing is simply more persuasive than telling.</p>





    <p>Okay, so why am I rambling on about OxiClean and dirty shoes? You can apply this same persuasive strategy to your Reflection Memo.</p>
