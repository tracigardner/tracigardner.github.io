    <h3 style="color: #861f41;">Announcement: Sell Your Revision by Showing Your Work </h3>

    <p>You may have had a teacher who talked about <strong style="color: #861f41;">&ldquo;showing, not telling&rdquo;</strong> in your writing. The idea is pretty straightforward. It&rsquo;s exactly what it says: Show the reader whatever you are exploring. Don&rsquo;t just tell them about it. Make it vivid and visual. Leave the reader with a clear understanding of exactly what you are discussing.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve probably been this strategy at work your entire life. Take look at Figure 1, before and after images of a pair of shoes. The first shoe has brown stains, and the second shoe is bright white and clean.</p>

    <figure style="width: 300px;float: right;margin-left: 15px;margin-top: 0;"><img src="../../-images/oxiclean-fabric-stain-removers-5.png" alt="Before and after images of two shoes, one dirty and the other bright white and clean" style="width: 300px;">
        <figcaption class="small">Figure 1. Before and after images of two shoes<br>

    <p>This before and after image is used <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/OxiClean-5-lbs-White-Revive-Powder-Fabric-Stain-Remover-51652/205689798?MERCH=REC-_-pip_alternatives-_-317245582-_-205689798-_-N#overlay" target="_blank">on the HomeDepot website</a> to sell OxiClean. The marketing strategy <strong style="color: #861f41;">shows</strong> the reader what the product can do. &ldquo;Just look at the difference between these two shoes,&rdquo; it yells. &ldquo;You could have these results too! Just buy OxiClean!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Imagine the alternative. Perhaps you&rsquo;re listening to a commercial on the radio or a podcast.</p>
