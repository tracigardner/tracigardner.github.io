    <h3 style="color: #861f41;">Announcement: Sell Your Revision by Showing Your Work </h3>

    <p>You may have a teacher who talked about &ldquo;showing, not telling&rdquo; in your writing. The idea is pretty straightforward. It&rsquo;s exactly what it says: Show the reader whatever you are exploring. Don&rsquo;t just tell them about it. Make it vivid and visual. Leave the reader with a clear understanding of exactly what you are discussing.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve probably been this strategy at work your entire life. Take look at Figure 1, before and after images of a pair of shoes. The first shoe has brown stains, and the second shoe is bright white and clean.</p>

    <figure style="width: 300px;float: right;margin-left: 15px;"><img src="../../-images/oxiclean-fabric-stain-removers-5.png" alt="Before and after images of two shoes, one dirty and the other bright white and clean" style="width: 300px;">
        <figcaption class="small">Figure 1. Before and after images of two shoes<br>
