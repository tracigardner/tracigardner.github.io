    <h3 style="color: #861f41;font-weight: bold;">Announcement: Sell Your Revision by Showing Your Work </h3>
    <p>You may have had a teacher who talked about <strong style="color: #861f41;">&ldquo;showing, not telling&rdquo;</strong> in your writing. The idea is pretty straightforward. It&rsquo;s exactly what it says: Show the reader whatever you are exploring. Don&rsquo;t just tell them about it. Make it vivid and visual. Leave the reader with a clear understanding of exactly what you are discussing.</p>
    <h4 style="color: #c64600;font-weight: bold;">An Example of the &ldquo;Show, Don&rsquo;t Tell&rdquo; Strategy</h4>
    <div style="width: 300px;float: right;margin-left: 15px;">
        <figure style="margin-bottom: 36px;"><img src="../../-images/oxiclean-fabric-stain-removers-5.png" alt="Before and after images of two shoes, one dirty and the other bright white and clean" style="width: 300px;">

        <figure><img src="../../-images/52339_TideBelize_POD_EN-US_Origi.png" alt="Before and after images of two shoes, one dirty and the other bright white and clean" style="width: 300px;">
            <figcaption class="small">Figure 2. Tide Pod image, listing product features.
                Image from <a href="https://tide.com/en-us/shop/type/laundry-pods/tide-pods-laundry-detergent" target="_blank">the Tide website</a>.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>

    <p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen this strategy at work your entire life. Take look at Figure 1, before and after images of a pair of shoes. The first shoe has brown stains, and the second shoe is bright white and clean.</p>

    <p>This before and after image is used in a photo gallery <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/OxiClean-5-lbs-White-Revive-Powder-Fabric-Stain-Remover-51652/205689798?MERCH=REC-_-pip_alternatives-_-317245582-_-205689798-_-N#overlay" target="_blank">on the HomeDepot website</a> to sell OxiClean. The marketing strategy <strong style="color: #861f41;">shows</strong> the reader what the product can do. &ldquo;Just look at the difference between these two shoes,&rdquo; it yells. &ldquo;You could have these results too! Just buy OxiClean!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Consider the alternative in Figure 2. The marketing image is one of several from a page on <a href="https://tide.com/en-us/shop/type/laundry-pods/tide-pods-laundry-detergent" target="_blank">the Tide website</a> The image is bright orange and blue. It <strong style="color: #861f41;">shows</strong> what a Tide Pod looks like, but that&rsquo;s as far as it goes. The rest of the image focuses on <strong style="color: #861f41;">telling</strong> the reader about the Pod&rsquo;s &ldquo;3 in 1&rdquo; features:</p>

    <ul style="margin-left: 24px;list-style-image: url('../../-images/noun-checkmark-7426487-861F41-24px.png');">
        <li>Concentrated detergent</li>
        <li>Stain removers</li>
        <li>Color protector</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Unlike the OxiClean image, the Tide image includes nothing to <strong style="color: #861f41;">show</strong> the reader how effective it is at removing stains or protecting colors. It just tells the reader that it does. </p>

    <p>Now compare the two images. Which is more persuasive? Being <strong style="color: #861f41;">told</strong> about what Tide does, or being <strong style="color: #861f41;">shown</strong> what OxiClean does? Most people would say being shown the results of using the product. Showing is simply more persuasive than telling.</p>

    <h4 style="color: #c64600;font-weight: bold;">Applying the &ldquo;Show, Don&rsquo;t Tell&rdquo; Strategy</h4>
    <p>Okay, so why am I rambling on about Tide Pods and dirty shoes? You can apply this same persuasive strategy to the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/assignments/2273827" target="_blank">Reflection Memo that accompanies your User Documentation Revision</a>.</p>
    <p>Your Reflection Memo discusses the changes you make to the user documentation to improve its usability. The goal is to explain what the user documentation got right, what it got wrong, and what you did to make it a stronger, more effective document.</p>
    <p>So what&rsquo;s the best way to convince your reader (me, Traci) that you improved the user documentation? <strong style="color: #861f41;">Show, Don&rsquo;t Tell!</strong> Include passages, images, and other strategies to <strong style="color: #861f41;">show</strong> how you&rsquo;ve improved the documentation.</p>

    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example from a previous term:</p>

    <blockquote style="margin-left: 48px;">

        <p>Prior to my edits, the documents design features were sub-par at best. The document included bulky paragraphs and one poorly written list. As mentioned in the previous section, most of my edits consisted of deleting redundant sentences. As a result, I was able to slim the bulky paragraphs. To more effectively chunk the paragraphs, I created lists wherever it was possible.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This passage describes changes that the student made. It <strong style="color: #861f41;">tells</strong> about them. To see the changes, the author suggests the reader go look at changes &ldquo;on pages 1, 3, and 4.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Now, consider this example, from another student:</p>


    <blockquote style="margin-left: 48px;">
        <p>The language within the original document was rather jargon-filled and fell short in its overly complicated sentence structure making it difficult to follow. One sentence that included unnecessarily detailed information reads:</p>

        <blockquote style="margin-left: 48px;">
            <p>Appropriate restraint is all about empathy, finesse, and technique&mdash;it has little to do with strength. If any procedure requires more than two people to actually hold the animal, there is something wrong with the employed technique for that procedure on that animal for that day. The more people that are involved, the more threatened the animal will feel and the more easily someone will be injured. [66 words]</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>which I shortened to</p>

        <blockquote style="margin-left: 48px;">
            <p>Handling animals requires care, skill, and a gentle approach&mdash;not force. If more than two people are needed, the technique may not be right for the situation or the animal. More handlers mean more stress for the animal and a higher risk of injury. [43 words]</p>
        </blockquote>


        <p>This works exceptionally better with getting the point across without being too wordy, especially since the information that I chose to delete is mentioned elsewhere in the document which also avoids repetition, another issue within the original documents language.</p>
    </blockquote>
