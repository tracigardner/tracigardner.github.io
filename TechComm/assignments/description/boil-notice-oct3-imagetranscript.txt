The image is an infographic titled "What it takes to lift a Boil Water Notice" and includes several steps involved in the process:

Water quality tests throughout the entire water distribution and storage systems must pass established VDH guidelines.
Water supply lines are flushed through fire hydrants and flushing valves.
All water storage tanks within the NRV Regional Water Authority service area must be disinfected before the final water samples can be taken. This process takes a minimum of 74 hours per tank.
NRV Water Authority and members complete two rounds of testing on water supply systems.
Each round takes up to 24 hours to complete.
Virginia Department of Health (VDH) will determine water is safe for consumption.
The infographic concludes with: Once water is safe, the notice will be lifted.
