    <h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
    <p>Tell me about the topic and format you have chosen for your technical description, which will visualize an item or process related to your Recommendation Report. You will incorporate your description into your report later in the term.</p>
    <h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
    <p>Description is a basic skill you will use frequently in the workplace. You will need to describe ideas to clients, managers, and the public. You might describe a new product or a new process. This week, I want you to tell me a few things about your topic so that I can make sure you have chosen something that works for the project.</p>
    <h3>How You Do It</h3>
    <ol class="skipline">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Review these examples to get an idea of the kinds of projects that work for this assignment:
        <ul class="null">
          <ul>
            <li>From NASA: <a href="https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/water-cycle#:~:text=The%20water%20cycle%20describes%20how,to%20the%20surface%20as%20precipitation.">The Water Cycle</a> (image with short text).</li>
            <li>From NOAA:
              <ul class="null">
                <li><a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/freshwater/water-cycle">Water Cycle</a> (image with longer text).</li>
                <li><a href="https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/watercycle/">The Water Cycle</a> (video with captions).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>From USGS:
              <ul class="null">
                <li><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/water-cycle-adults-and-advanced-students-many-languages?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects">The Water Cycle for Adults and Advanced Students </a>(multiple pages with images and text).</li>

                <li><a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercycle-kids-adv.html">The Water Cycle for Schools and Students: Advanced students</a> (interactive image).</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/water-cycle-adults-and-advanced-students-many-languages?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects">The Water Cycle in Many Languages</a> (images and text that are translated to many languages). Your project must be written in English, but if looking at an example in another language would help, this is the site to use!</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Decide on an item or process related to the situation you are exploring in your recommendation report, following these guidelines:
            <ul class="null">
              <li>Since we are using the water cycle as an example, do not use that topic.</li>
              <li>Choose a simple item or process that you already understand to avoid needing outside research.</li>
              <li>Be sure that you can explain the item or process in your own words.You do not need outside sources.</li>
              <li>Focus on an item or process you can explain in a couple of paragraphs. NASA&rsquo;s <a href="https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/water-cycle#:~:text=The%20water%20cycle%20describes%20how,to%20the%20surface%20as%20precipitation.">The Water Cycle</a> is a good example of the appropriate length.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Choose a visual format for your technical description. Choose a format you are already familiar with so that you can focus on the content. For instance, if you have never made an interactive HTML5 webpage (like the interactive image in the USGS list above), this is not the time to learn how. For this project, you can create any of the following:
            <ul class="null">
              <li>an image with explanatory text beside it (as a word processor document or webpage)</li>
              <li>a video</li>
              <li>a comic or graphic novel</li>
              <li>a poster with included explanatory text</li>
              <li>an interactive webpage or image</li>
              <li>something else&mdash;you can propose another format by emailing me.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Complete the quiz to tell me:
            <ul class="null">
              <li>What item or process will you focus on.</li>
              <li>What visual format will you use.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
    <p>You track and grade your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">Track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
      <li class="skipline"><span style="margin-bottom: 42px;">When you submit your work, the points will be recorded in Canvas Grades automatically. I will review your answers. If I find that you did not put in appropriate effort or did not do the expected work, I will adjust your grade accordingly.</span></li>
