<h2 style="color: #e87722;">The Task</h2>
<p>This assignment asks you to create a rough draft of a technical description that visualizes a process from your field or that you are learning. You will revise your draft and submit the final version next week.</p>
<h3 style="color: #861f41;">Completely Imaginary Writing Scenario</h3>
<blockquote>
<div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fdfbda; border: 1px solid #d7d2cb;">
<p style="font-weight: 500;">A club you are a member of is arranging an open house for middle school students who are interested in your field, but who have no advanced knowledge of the discipline. Members of the club are each contributing a technical description of a process in the field. The goal is to connect with students who will apply to your department at Virginia Tech in the future. Club members will share the processes at the open house and the finished documents will be posted on the club website so that the guests can refer to them later.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 500;">At the last club meeting, everyone discussed that these technical descriptions need to be attractive to the middle school students. A couple of paragraphs of explanation alone is not going to be enough. The group resolved to focus on visualizing the processes in ways that would draw students in.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 500;">[This is a fictional scenario.]</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="color: #861f41;">Composing Your Rough Draft</h3>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Review these examples to get an idea of the kinds of projects that work for this assignment:
<ul>
<li>From NASA: <a href="https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/water-cycle#:~:text=The%20water%20cycle%20describes%20how,to%20the%20surface%20as%20precipitation.">The Water Cycle</a> (image with short text).</li>
<li>From NOAA:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/freshwater/water-cycle">Water Cycle</a> (image with longer text).</li>
<li><a href="https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/watercycle/">The Water Cycle</a> (video with captions).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From USGS:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/water-cycle-adults-and-advanced-students-many-languages?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects">The Water Cycle for Adults and Advanced Students </a>(multiple pages with images and text).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/water-cycle-schools?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects">The Water Cycle for Schools</a> (image and text).</li>
<li><a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercycle-kids-adv.html">The Water Cycle for Schools and Students: Advanced students</a> (interactive image).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/water-cycle-adults-and-advanced-students-many-languages?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects">The Water Cycle in Many Languages</a> (images and text that are translated to many languages). Your project must be written in English, but if looking at an example in another language would help, this is the site to use!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Decide on a process to explain, following these guidelines:
<ul>
<li>Since we are using the water cycle as an example, do not use that topic.</li>
<li>Choose a simple processe that you already understand, so that you do not need to conduct extensive research.</li>
<li>Be sure that you can explain the process in your own words. This project does not need paraphrase or quotation from outside sources.</li>
<li>Focus on a basic process that you can explain in a couple of paragraphs. NASA&rsquo;s <a href="https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/water-cycle#:~:text=The%20water%20cycle%20describes%20how,to%20the%20surface%20as%20precipitation.">The Water Cycle</a> is a good example of the appropriate length.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Choose a visual format for your technical description. Choose a format that you are already familiar with so that you can focus on the content. For instance, if you have never made an interactive HTML5 webpage (like the interactive image in the USGS list below), this is not the time to learn how. For this project, you can create any of the following:
<ul>
<li>an image with explanatory text beside it (as a word processor document or webpage)</li>
<li>a video</li>
<li>a comic or graphic novel</li>
<li>a poster with included explanatory text</li>
<li>an interactive webpage or image</li>
<li>something else&mdash;you can propose another format by emailing me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As you work on your technical description, keep these requirements in mind:
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Technology Requirements:</strong> You will either upload your project or provide a link to it in Canvas. Because this is a creative project, there are different expectations for the rough and final drafts:<br />
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="color: #e87722; font-stretch: extra-expanded; font-weight: 400;">For the rough version</span>: Your draft should give me a clear idea of what you are planning and should include some of the text you will use. It does not have to be polished however, and it can be an alternate format if it makes sense for your project. For instance, if you are working on a video, you could turn in a script and/or some storyboards. If you are working on an image, you might sketch out your ideas on paper, take a photo with your phone, and turn in your photo.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="color: #e87722; font-stretch: extra-expanded; font-weight: 400;">For the final version:</span> You will either upload your project or provide a link to it in Canvas.&nbsp; You can use a word processor document, an image file (jpg, png, gif),&nbsp; a PDF, or a webpage. If you&rsquo;re desperate to use some other format, e-mail me about it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
<div style="width: 240px; height: auto; padding: 6px; border: 3px double #e87722; float: right; text-align: left; margin-left: 15px; font-size: 14px;"><img src="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/files/16639771/download?wrap=1" alt="Cover of Markel &amp; Selber" width="240" height="270" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/126055/files/16639771" data-api-returntype="File" /><br />Page numbers refer to Markel &amp; Selber&rsquo;s <em>Technical Communication</em>, 12th edition.</div>

<li>How does it work? (p. 551)</li>
<li>What are its principal steps? (p. 551)</li>
<li>Is there a graphic identifying all the principal steps? (p. 552)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Provide detailed information</strong> that accomplishes the following:
<ul>
<li>Answers, for each of the major steps, the questions listed above in the section on introducing the description (p. 550).</li>
<li>Discusses the steps in chronological order or some other logical sequence (p. 551).</li>
<li>Makes clear the causal relationships among the steps (p. 551).</li>
<li>Includes a clear visualization of the concept, with information on each of the principal steps (p. 552).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Summarizes the major points in the step-by-step description (p. 552).</li>
<li>Discusses, if appropriate, the importance or implications of the process (p. 552).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Use professional design and formatting</strong> that does the following:
<ul>
<li>Pays attention to the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/document-design/page--put-crap-in-your-document-design.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRAP design principles</a>.</li>
<li>Makes information easy for readers to find and read.</li>
<li>Emphasizes important information.</li>
<li>Makes a good first impression as a polished, professional document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Do not use watermarked images</strong> (such as those that indicate the image is owned by someone else).</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Be sure everything works.</strong> Watch out for grammar, spelling, punctuation, mechanics, linking, and formatting.</li>
