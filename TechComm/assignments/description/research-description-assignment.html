<h2>What You Will Learn and Practice</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze the rhetorical situation and determine the appropriate audience or users of written communication, considering the needs of global audiences and people with disabilities. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 1]</li>
  <li>Conduct research appropriate to workplace problem solving, such as literature review, evaluation of online resources, interview, and site inspection. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 2]</li>
  <li>Interpret research findings with understanding of ethical and human implications. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 3]</li>
  <li>Use conventions of various workplace genres, such as proposals, instructions, correspondence, reports, and slide decks, with understanding of how the genre conventions can be used as heuristics and as principles of arrangement. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 4]</li>

<p>Compose a working draft of your technical description, which describes the research process that you have followed while working on your recommendation report. You will incorporate your description into the Methods section of your recommendation report later in the term.</p>
<h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
<p>Describing a  process for someone  requires you to think from someone else’s perspective. You have to outline exactly what the process entails so that your readers understand. </p>
<p>Tracking and describing your research process as you complete your secondary and primary research will also give you the basic information you need for the Methods section of your report. </p>
<h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 20, “Writing Descriptions,” pp. 561–569.

  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">The details on the Methods Section, from p. 493:<br>
        “The methods section answers the question ‘What did you do?’ In drafting the methods section, consider your readers&rsquo; knowledge of the field, their perception of you, and the uniqueness of the project, as well as their reasons for reading the report and their attitudes toward the project. Provide enough information to enable readers to understand what you did and why you did it that way. If others will be using the report to duplicate your methods, include sufficient detail.”</li>

<h2>When to Do It</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li><strong>Suggested Due Date: </strong>Finish your  draft by 11:59 PM on Friday, September 17, 2021 to submit for  feedback from me and your classmates.</li>
  <li><strong>Second-Chance Due Date:</strong> Finish your draft by 11:59 PM on Wednesday, September 22, 2021 to submit for  feedback from me and your classmates.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Chance Date:</strong> The grace period for your pitch video ends at 11:59 PM on Friday, December 3, 2021.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How You Do It</h2>
<h3>Work on Your Description Draft</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li>Review the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/pages/technical-description-criteria" target="_blank">Technical Description Criteria</a> to assess how you are doing and consider what you need help with. </li>
  <li>Complete the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/quizzes/299268" target="_blank">Introducing Your Research Description</a> to begin gathering the relevant information for your description.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Return to your work logs to find notes on the chronological order of your research process and add that information to your draft.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Create a first draft of your technical description that informs your readers, viewers, and/or listeners about the item or process.   </li>
  </ol>
<h3>Improve Your Description Draft</h3>
<p>The following activities will all contribute to your Technical Description and to the Methods section of your Recommendation Report. You can complete all of these activities, or you can pick and choose—just be sure that you put in your best work and record what you do in your work log.</p>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li>Share your first draft (or as much of a draft as you have) in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/discussion_topics/1102598" target="_blank">Research Description Feedback Discussion</a> in Canvas. Next week, use the feedback you receive to revise your work.</li>
  <li>If you missed the original chance for feedback, you can try the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/discussion_topics/1122971" target="_blank">Second-Chance </a><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/discussion_topics/1102598" target="_blank">Research Description</a> <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/discussion_topics/1122971" target="_blank">Feedback Discussion</a> in Canvas.</li>
  <li>You will continue to develop your draft, recording all of the details on your research process until your research is complete.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Assess &amp; Track Your Work</h2>
  <p>You track and grade your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
  <ul class="skipline">
    <li>Track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/136796/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
    <li>I will give you feedback when you turn in your description to one of the feedback discussions. 
      Since this is a part of the working draft for your Technical Description, you do not  turn it in separately. </li>
  </ul>
