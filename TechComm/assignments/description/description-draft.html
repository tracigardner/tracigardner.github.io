    <h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
    <p>Create a first draft of your technical description, which visualizes an object or process related to your recommendation report. You will incorporate your description into your recommendation report later in the term.</p>
    <h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
    <p>Visualizing an object or process for someone who is unfamiliar with it requires you to think from someone else’s perspective. By beginning your draft now, you should have time to work out the deatils that someone needs to know to understand the object or process you are describing. Since the description will ultimately be part of your recommendtion report, you need to be sure that your readers will understand.</p>
    <h3>How You Do It</h3>
    <ol class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">Create a first draft of your technical description that informs your readers, viewers, and/or listeners about the item or process. As you did with your pitch and instructions, you get to choose what your first version looks like. Here are some examples:
        <ul class="null">
          <li class="null">Shoot some video footage of the object or a step in the process.</li>
          <li class="null">Write a script for your descriptive video.</li>
          <li class="null">Take photos to illustrate your description.</li>
          <li class="null">Sketch out an outline for your written description and begin filling in the details.</li>
          <li class="null">Choose an infographic tool (like Adobe Spark) and begin designing your description.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Review the<a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/technical-description-criteria" target="_blank"> technical description criteria</a> to assess how you are doing and consider what you need help with. </li>
      <li>Share your some portion of your first version (all of it or just part of it, whatever will help you most) in this week&rsquo;s Discussion in Canvas, following the instructions in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/discussion_topics/1042966" target="_blank">Technical Description Draft Feedback Discussion</a>. <strong>Post your draft by Thursday</strong> so that others in your group have time to provide feedback.</li>
      <li>Submit evidence of your work on your first version to this assignment. You can decide what to submit, based on what you worked on. Here are some examples of what you can submit:
        <ul class="null">
          <li class="null">Video footage you created.</li>
          <li class="null">Images (such as photographs) that you created or shot.</li>
          <li class="null">Your storyboard or outline.</li>
          <li class="null">Your script (or a portion of your script).</li>
          <li class="null">A written explanation of what you did this week.</li>
          <li class="null">Some other kind of evidence that will show your work.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
