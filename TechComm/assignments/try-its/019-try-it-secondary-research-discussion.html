        <div style="padding: 12px; border: 3px double #861f41; background-color: #fff8dc; font-size: 18px; width: 300px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;">

            <p>You can use the online texts, any notes that you have, and the available course pages in Canvas for help as you work on these questions. You can also talk to one another.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Collect secondary research for your Recommendation Report by meeting with your group, choosing relevant outside resources, and then gathering details on the sources you&rsquo;ve chosen.</p>

        <p>Each group member should write at least two posts. You&rsquo;ll each collect information on at least two research sources. Post on each source separately (e.g., source one in post one, and source two in post two).</p>

        <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18pt;">How This Activity Connects to the Course</h2>
        <p>You and your group are working directly on your Recommendation Report by gathering the information that you will include in your report. You usually use your secondary research to explain why the website guidelines you are using matter (for instance, why color can help readability). You can also use details on the effectiveness of design choices to demonstrate why making changes is likely to improve the website.</p>

        <h2 id="how-to-do-it" style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18pt;">How to Do It</h2>
        <p>There are two sections to this discussion. First, you&rsquo;ll meet and decide which sources to review and who will work on each one. Second, each group member will read their two sources and write a post for each.</p>

        <h3 id="before-meeting">Before You Meet</h3>
        <ol class="skipline" id="before-meeting-inst">
            <li>Connect with the members of your group to arrange a meeting time that fits everyone&rsquo;s schedules. You can meet using whatever system works best for your group. You can meet for both this Try-It and Try-It #20 at the same time.

                            <li>Post ideas in a Canvas Group Discussion. The following links can help you:

                            </li>

                            <li>Meet in person on campus or another convenient location.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </details>
            </li>

            <li>Before you meet, prepare by doing these tasks so that you are ready to decide what you want to focus on for your secondary research:
                <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
                    <li>Read the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/recommendation-report-research-guide" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Research Guide</a>, paying particular attention to the options for secondary research.</li>
                    <li>(Optional, if needed) Review your website so that you are familiar with the pages your group will examine in the Recommendation Report.</li>
                    <li>Review the questions below that you&rsquo;ll gather for each source so that you understand the expectations.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="meeting">Meeting with Your Group</h3>
        <ol class="skipline" start="3">
            <li>Meet with your group as scheduled to choose the sources your group will review for your Recommendation Report.
                <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>If you want, begin with the list of sources under the &ldquo;Secondary Research for Your Recommendation Report&rdquo; heading on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/recommendation-report-research-guide" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Research Guide</a>. You are not limited to these sources however.</li>
                    <li>Add any other sources that will help you make your recommendations. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>Choose the documentation style that you will use for your Recommendation Report. You can choose whatever system you want (e.g., IEEE, MLA, APA, CMS), but be sure that everyone is using the same system so your documentation is consistent. Find helpful resources on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/documentation-and-citations-for-your-projects" target="_blank">Documentation and Citations for Your Report</a> page.</li>

            <li>Once your group has decided on the sources to review, choose two sources for each group member to read and post about.</li>

            <li>Make a plan you&rsquo;ll follow if a member finds that a source doesn&rsquo;t work out. You can change the resources if you need to, but everyone needs to know about the change and agree.</li>

            <li>Together, add one post that outlines your decisions by listing this information, which also works as your to-do list for this Try-It.:
                <ul class="null">
                    <li>Names of group members who are present for the meeting.</li>
                    <li>The Target Due Date you set to have all research collected.</li>
                    <li>The Documentation Style you choose.</li>
                    <li>Names of the Group Members present.</li>
                    <li>The two sources (title and link) each member signs up for.</li>
                    <li>Your plan for making changes if any sources don&rsquo;t turn out.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

                    <p><strong>Add a note</strong> that indicates the specific AI tool it was written by. Something simple at the end of the summary works. Here&rsquo;s an example: Summary written by Copilot.</p>

                Read the sources that you signed up for, looking for key details that will help with the analysis of your website and your recommendations to improve it.
            </li>

            <li>Write your <strong>first individual reply post</strong> by following these steps:

                <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">

                    <li>Reply to this discussion.</li>

                    <li>Add a <strong>one- or two-word keyword</strong> that captures the topic of the source (for instance, Color).</li>

                    <li>Post a <strong>bibliographic citation</strong> for your source, using the documentation style that your group has decided to use (e.g., IEEE, MLA). There are citations generators you can use on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/documentation-and-citations-for-your-projects" target="_blank">Documentation and Citations for Your Report</a> page.</li>

                    <li>Add a <strong>Summary</strong> heading. Under it, tell your group what the source covers. Aim for 100&ndash;200 words (but I won&rsquo;t count).</li>

                    <li>Add a <strong>Useful Quotations</strong> heading. Under it, add two or three direct quotations that could be used in your report. You&rsquo;ll need to choose these yourself.</li>

                    <li>If your source has pages (for instance, it&rsquo;s a journal article), add the relevant <strong>page number</strong> for the quotation.</li>

                    <li id="doc-design">Use <a title="How do I add and modify text in the Rich Content Editor as a student?" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-add-and-modify-text-in-the-Rich-Content-Editor-as-a/ta-p/322" target="_blank">document design features</a> to make your keyword and headings stand out from the rest of the content in your post.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li id="replies-second-post">In <strong>your second individual post</strong>, repeat the process in Step 9 (directly above) for the second source you have signed up for.</li>

            <li>Read through all the posts your group adds so that you are familiar with the content and can use these sources as you work on your Recommendation Report.</li>

        </ol>

        <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18pt;">Assessment</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">I will mark your participation in this Discussion Complete (or Incomplete) after the end of the Grace Period passes and after I confirm that you were present for the group meeting and added two replies (one for each of the sources you reviewed). Allow me several days to read and mark all your posts. I will assess group members individually based on their participation.</p>
