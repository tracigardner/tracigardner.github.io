    <p>This activity asks you to answer a series of questions to brainstorm details for your report’s introduction. These questions come from the “Introduction” section of Chapter 18 of Markel &amp; Selber. Once you answer these questions, incorporate the details in your report.</p>
    <p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Canvas automatically marks your work Complete when you submit it. &nbsp;All you have to do is TRY the activity. It&rsquo;s okay if you make mistakes. Recognize however that if you have not put in an effort to do the work, I may remove the Complete mark.</p>
    <h2>Question 1</h2>
    <p>What is the subject of the report? If the report follows a proposal and a progress report, you can probably copy this information from one of those documents, modifying it as necessary. Reusing this information is efficient and ethical.</p>
    <h2>Question 2 </h2>
    <p>What is the purpose of the report? The purpose of the report is not the purpose of the project. The purpose of the report is to explain a project from beginning (identifying a problem or an opportunity) to end (presenting recommendations).<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Question 3</h2>
    <p>What is the background of the report? Include this information, even if you have presented it before; some of your readers might not have read your previous documents or might have forgotten them.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Question 4 </h2>
    <p>What are your sources of information? Briefly describe your primary and secondary research, to prepare your readers for a more detailed discussion of your sources in subsequent sections of the report.</p>
    <h2>Question 5 </h2>
    <p> What is the scope of the report? Indicate the topics you are including, as well as those you are not.</p>
    <h2>Question 6</h2>
    <p>What are the most significant findings? Summarize the most significant findings of the project.</p>
    <h2>Question 7</h2>
    <p> What are your recommendations? In a short report containing a few simple recommendations, include those recommendations in the introduction. In a lengthy report containing many complex recommendations, briefly summarize them in the introduction, then refer readers to the more detailed discussion in the recommendations section.</p>
    <h2>Question 8</h2>
    <p>What is the organization of the report? Indicate your organizational pattern so that readers can understand where you are going and why.</p>
    <h2>Question 9</h2>
    <p>What key terms are you using in the report? The introduction is an appropriate place to define new terms. If you need to define many terms, place the definitions in a glossary and refer readers to it in the introduction.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Question 10</h2>
    <p>I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this assignment.</p>
