        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Grace Period Reminder</h3>
        <p>Group Discussions have a three-day grace period since group interactions need to take place in a timely manner. The grace period for this Try-It ends at 11:59 PM on Wednesday, [TBD].</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">What You Need to Do</h3>
        <p>Read and respond to a workplace scenario that presents an ethical dilemma. In your response address what to do in the situation and suggest strategies to avoid the dilemma in the future. Discuss the posted options, and write a group recommendation that addresses both what to do in the situation and what to do to avoid the situation in the future.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">How This Activity Connects to the Course</h3>
        <p>Ethical considerations matter in everything that you write in the workplace. You may well find yourself in a similar situation once you graduate (or even sooner as an intern).</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Read the scenario below and consider the ethical dilemma involved for the senior technical writer Alex.</li>
            <li>Respond to the scenario in <strong>your first post</strong> explaining what you would do in this situation. In your discussion response, please do the following:
                <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>Present a position statement that answers &ldquo;What would you do in this situation?&rdquo;sw

            <li>Interact with your group in <strong>additional posts</strong> to discuss the solution your group would recommend and the actions Alex&rsquo;s team should take to avoid such dilemmas in the future.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with your group to summarize your positions and synthesize the information to <strong>post a clear statement</strong> of your group&rsquo;s recommendation at the end of this Discussion.</li>
        </ol>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>The Use of AI in Technical Writing</strong></h3>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <figure style="float: right;margin-left: 12px;""><img style=" height: 300px;width: 300px;" src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/aiysha-ethics.png" alt="A focused Black woman with long braided hair and stylish jewelry, working on a laptop in a office setting, with other coworkers in the background.">

            </figure>
            <p>Alex is a technical writer at a large tech company that frequently uses AI tools to generate documentation, user manuals, and internal reports. Recently, Alex has been tasked with overseeing the implementation of a new AI writing assistant designed to streamline the creation of technical documents.</p>
            <p>After a few months of use, Alex and the team notice that some AI-generated documents contain subtle biases, stereotypes, and occasionally discriminatory language. For example, the AI might generate sentences that implicitly suggest gender roles, make assumptions about cultural backgrounds, or use language that may not be inclusive of all users.</p>
            <p>The company values diversity and inclusivity and has a strict policy against any form of bias in its communications. As a senior technical writer, Alex is responsible for ensuring that all documentation aligns with these values. Alex must address this issue and develop a strategy to mitigate biases in AI-generated content.</p>

            <h2>Options for Alex</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct a thorough review of all AI-generated content to identify instances of bias and revise them manually.</li>
                <li>Develop and implement guidelines for using the AI tool that emphasize the importance of avoiding biased language.</li>
                <li>Work with the AI development team to refine the language model and training data to reduce biases.</li>
                <li>Implement regular training sessions for the team on recognizing and addressing bias in AI-generated content.</li>
                <li>Establish a review committee with diverse members to monitor AI-generated content for bias and provide feedback.</li>
                <li>Consider using multiple AI tools and cross-referencing outputs to minimize the influence of any single biased model.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Issues to Consider as You Decide What Alex Should Do</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>What steps can Alex take to identify and correct biases in AI-generated technical documents?</li>
                <li>How can Alex ensure that the AI tool adheres to the company's values of diversity and inclusivity?</li>
                <li>What measures can be implemented to regularly review and update the AI's language model to prevent future biases?</li>
                <li>What role should human oversight play in the use of AI for generating technical documentation?</li>
                <li>How can Alex involve a diverse team in the process of monitoring and refining AI-generated content?</li>
                <li>Which of the options listed do you think would be the most effective in addressing the issue of bias in AI-generated content? Why?</li>
            </ol>
