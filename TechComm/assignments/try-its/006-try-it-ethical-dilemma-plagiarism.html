            <p><img style="float: right;margin-left: 12px;" src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/noun-submarine-4612489-yellow.png" alt="Yellow Submarine with the company's name, Hydronautic Technologies on top">Divya Singh leads a five-member team of engineers and scientists who for Hydronautic Technologies, a company that develops robotic submersibles. Divya and her team have been asked to write a first draft of user documentation for a newly-designed submersible.</p>
            <p>The company&lsquo;s technical editors will create a second version of the documentation that addresses any issues in corporate style, grammar, and punctuation. The editorial team needs two weeks to complete their work.</p>
            <p>The schedule is very tight, as the xxx buying the submersible needs speedy delivery in order to meet their contracts with.


                The company has contracted to deliver the submersible and related documentation in three weeks. A clause in the contract penalizes Hydronautics $10,000 a day for every day late they are in delivery.</p>




            Franklin works as an environmental engineer for Outdoor Compliance Associates. She and her team are responsible for writing analytical reports called environmental impact statements (EISs) on sites that might be developed for housing or businesses. An EIS is required by the government before any work can begin.</p>
            <p>Lissa&rsquo;s responsibility on the team is to track down any historical uses of the site. For example, if she learns that a gas station had once been on the site, her job is to make sure the old underground holding tanks were removed. If the site once held a factory, her job is to make sure that chemicals had not been dumped in the area. Lissa loves being an environmental detective.</p>
            <p>A year ago, Lissa&rsquo;s team had written an EIS for a site where a new apartment complex was planned. The site was about a mile from a major research university. While researching the site, Lissa discovered that it had housed part of the city&rsquo;s waste treatment center until the early 1950s. Lissa&rsquo;s discovery wasn&rsquo;t a problem, though, because any contaminants would have disappeared long ago. So Lissa&rsquo;s team wrote a favorable EIS, clearing the way for development. The building plan was approved by the city, and construction started soon after.</p>
            <p>Then, yesterday, an old, yellowed file mysteriously appeared in Lissa&rsquo;s office mailbox. The file was marked &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo; and had no return address. Lissa looked inside.</p>
            <p>In the file was a report that nuclear weapons research had once been conducted at the university during the 1940s. Not recognizing the potential harm of the nuclear waste, the scientists had sent tons of radioactive waste down the drain. The nuclear waste ended up in the city&rsquo;s old waste treatment center. The waste, including the nuclear waste, was then spread around the grounds of the waste treatment plant.</p>
            <p>Lissa grabbed her Geiger counter and went out to the building site. The apartment development was now half built. When she pulled out her Geiger counter, it immediately began detecting significant amounts of radiation.</p>
            <p>The radiation wasn&rsquo;t high enough to violate government standards, but it was close. Lissa knew that the building permit still would have been granted even if knowledge of the site&rsquo;s nuclear past had been known. However, she also knew that as soon as people heard about the radiation, no one would want to live in the apartments. That would be a disaster for the developer building them.</p>
            <p>If she reported the radiation, there was also a good chance that Lissa&rsquo;s company would be sued by the builder for missing this important problem with the property. Moreover, other builders would likely never again hire her company to write an EIS. Lissa would almost certainly lose her job, and the company she worked for might be forced out of business. But then, he could keep quiet. After all, the radiation was not above government standards.</p>
            <p>If you were Lissa, how would you handle this situation?</p>
