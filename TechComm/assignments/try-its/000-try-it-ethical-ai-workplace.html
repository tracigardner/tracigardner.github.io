        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Grace Period Reminder</h3>
        <p>Group Discussions have a three-day grace period since group interactions need to take place in a timely manner. The grace period for this Try-It ends at 11:59 PM on Wednesday, [TBD].</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">What You Need to Do</h3>
        <p>Read and respond to a workplace scenario that presents an ethical dilemma. In your response address what to do in the situation and suggest strategies to avoid the dilemma in the future. Discuss the posted options, and write a group recommendation that addresses both what to do in the situation and what to do to avoid the situation in the future.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">How This Activity Connects to the Course</h3>
        <p>Ethical considerations matter in everything that you write in the workplace. You may well find yourself in a similar situation once you graduate (or even sooner as an intern). Additionally, you will consider how to proceed if members of your own group are missing when you work on your Teamwork Agreement during Week 7.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Instructions</h3>

            <li><strong>Post a clear statement</strong> of your group&rsquo;s recommendation at the end of this Discussion.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">The Scenario</h3>
        <div style="margin: 18px 40px;padding: 12px;border: 1px solid #861f41;background-color: #f9f9f9">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>Safety Concerns &amp; The Absent Team Member</strong></h3>
            <p><img style="float: right;margin-left: 12px;" src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/aiysha-ethics.png" alt="A focused Black woman with long braided hair and stylish jewelry, working on a laptop in a classroom setting, with other coworkers in the background." style="height: 300px;width: 300px;">Aiysha is a project manager at TechSolutions, a leading software development firm. The company recently adopted an advanced AI system called IntelliManage to help streamline project workflows, manage schedules, and provide data-driven recommendations for resource allocation. IntelliManage has significantly improved efficiency, reducing the time spent on administrative tasks and allowing project teams to focus more on creative and strategic aspects of their work.</p>

            <h2>Scenario</h2>
            <p>One day, Aiysha receives a notification from IntelliManage suggesting the termination of several low-performing team members based on productivity data and performance metrics. The AI system&rsquo;s recommendation is clear: replacing these employees with new hires or redistributing their tasks among existing high-performing team members will optimize project outcomes and increase profitability.</p>

            <p>Aiysha is concerned. While the data suggests that these employees are underperforming, she knows that several of them are dealing with personal issues that have temporarily affected their work. Additionally, she values their long-term potential and contribution to the team dynamic, which the AI might not fully appreciate. Aiysha also worries about the ethical implications of making personnel decisions based solely on AI recommendations.</p>

            <h2>Questions for Discussion</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Reliability and Bias:</strong> How reliable is the data and analysis provided by IntelliManage? Could there be inherent biases in the AI system that might unfairly target certain employees?</li>
                <li><strong>Human Judgment vs. AI Recommendations:</strong> To what extent should Aiysha rely on the AI&rsquo;s recommendations when making personnel decisions? What role should human judgment play in this process?</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> How transparent should TechSolutions be with its employees about the use of AI in performance evaluations and personnel decisions? Who should be held accountable if the AI system&rsquo;s recommendations lead to unfair or harmful outcomes?</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Implications:</strong> What are the ethical considerations involved in using AI to make decisions that significantly impact employees&rsquo; lives and careers? How can Aiysha balance the company&rsquo;s interests with the well-being of her team members?</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term Consequences:</strong> What might be the long-term consequences of relying heavily on AI for personnel decisions in terms of workplace culture, employee morale, and trust in management?</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Aiysha faces a challenging decision that requires her to weigh the benefits of AI-driven efficiency against the ethical and human dimensions of management. The discussion should explore the complexities of integrating AI into the workplace, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that considers both technological advantages and the human element.</p>
