<p>This activity reviews when sources need to be documented in your work. You will apply the ideas to some sentences from your report. Once you finish, incorporate the improved sentences in your report.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Canvas automatically marks your work Complete when you submit it. &nbsp;All you have to do is TRY the activity. It&rsquo;s okay if you make mistakes. Recognize however that if you have not put in an effort to do the work, I may remove the Complete mark.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Watch the LinkedIn Learning video “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/writing-a-business-report/when-to-use-documentation?u=57888345" target="_blank">When to use documentation</a>” (5m 44s), which describes all of the situations when you need to document your sources. The video will open in a new browser tab.</p>

<h2>Question 1</h2>
  <p>For your Recommendation Report, you should use the style that is appropriate for your career field. For instance, electrical engineers use IEEE, and biologists often use CSE. If you are unsure what to choose, use whatever style you are most comfortable with.</p>
  <p>What documentation system are you using?</p>
  <h2>Question 2  </h2>
 <p>In addition to documenting your sources, you need to frame your quotations. In their textbook <em>They Say / I Say</em>, Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein  explain the strategy with an analogy to a sandwich: </p>
 <blockquote>
   To adequately frame a quotation, you need to insert it into what we like to call a “quotation sandwich,” with the statement introducing it serving as the top slice of bread and the explanation following it serving as the bottom slice. The introductory or lead-in claims should explain who is speaking and set up what the quotation says; the follow-up statements should explain why you consider the quotation to be important and what you take it to say. (p.80)
 </blockquote>
    <p>The quotation sandwich provides a strong way to integrate your quotations into your report since it ensures that you always tell your reader what you are sharing before the quotation and then explain why you have included it after it is stated.</p>
  <h2>Question 3</h2>
 <p>Where have you used <strong>direct quotations of four or fewer lines</strong> in your report? Copy and paste an example into the answer. If you have not included a citation for your source or framed your quotation, do so before you move  to the next question.</p>

  <h2>Question 4</h2>
  <p>If you have used a<strong> direct quotation of five or more lines</strong> in your report, copy and paste the passage along with the sentence before and the sentence after the quotation.  As with the previous questions, if you have not included a citation for your source or framed your quotation, do so before you move  to the next question.</p>
  <p>If you have not included any longer quotations, state that the question is not applicable.</p>
  <h2>Question 5 </h2>
  <p> xxx</p>
  <h2>Question 6</h2>
  <p>xxx</p>
    <h2>Question 7</h2>
    <p> xxx </p>
  <h2>Question 8</h2>
    <p>xxx</p>
  <h2>Question 9</h2>
    <p>xxx<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Question 10</h2>
  <p>I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this assignment.</p>

      <li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">True</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">False</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Leftovers</h2>
    <p>This activity explains ways to improve the passages in your report where you use paraphrased information and direct quotations from your research to support your ideas. After reading some information, you will apply the ideas to some sentences from your report. Once you finish, incorporate the improved sentences in your report.</p>
