        <p style="padding: 12px; border: 3px double #861f41; background-color: #fff8dc; font-size: 24px;">You can use the online texts, any notes that you have, and the available course pages in Canvas for help as you work on these questions. You can also talk to one another.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Grace Period Reminder</h3>
        <p>All Try-Its have a three-day grace period for the rest of the term to ensure that group work goes smoothly.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18pt;">What You Need to Do</h2>
        <p>Discuss how you will include visual elements in your Recommendation Report. For your report to have a balanced and consistent look, you need to include graphic elements throughout the report (not just in one section). Decide together how you will distribute screenshots, tables, charts, and other visuals.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18pt;">How This Activity Connects to the Course</h2>
        <p>By planning for your visuals now, you will be able to gather them as you work on your report (rather than searching for them at the last minute). This Try-It essentially asks you to make a list of the visuals you should collect.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18pt;">Assessment</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">I will mark your participation in this Discussion Complete (or Incomplete) after the end of the Grace Period passes. Allow me several days to read and mark all your posts. I will assess group members individually based on their participation. Allow me several days to read and mark your work. </p>

        <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18pt;">How to Do It</h2>
        <ol id="how-to-do-it" class="skipline">
            <li>Read or review the <a href="https://pressbooks.library.tamu.edu/howdyorhello/chapter/integrating-visuals/" target="_blank">Integrating Visuals</a> page, looking for details on the information that can contribute effectively to your Recommendation Report.</li>

            <li>If needed, remind yourself of the tasks you are responsible for in your group&rsquo;s Recommendation Report by reviewing your Proposal and other notes.</li>

            <li id="first-post">In <strong>your first post</strong>, include the following information:
                <ul>
                    <li>List the section(s) of the body that you are responsible for.</li>

                    <li>State the specific kinds of visuals (e.g., screenshot, bar graph) you will include in your section(s).</li>

                    <li>Explain the exact information that you will include in each visual. (e.g., a table showing readability statistics, a screenshot of poor contrast on one of the webpages).</li>

                    <li>Indicate how work on the visual is going. Is it complete? Not started? Data gathered, but not charted yet? Give your group members a sense on your progress.</li>

                    <li>If you already have a draft of a chart or a screenshot, go ahead and include it in your post so the rest of the group sees what you&rsquo;ve done.</li>

                    <li>If you need help with the visuals, let your group members know.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li id="read-posts">Read the visual plans from the other members in your group, looking for ways to connect and coordinate the information in your report.
            </li>

            <li id="replies-second-post">In <strong>your second (and additional) posts</strong>, reply to other group members as appropriate:
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on connections you can make among the visuals and information in the text. For instance, if a group member is including a &ldquo;before&rdquo; screenshot of poor contrast on one of the pages of the website, you might suggest an &ldquo;after&rdquo; screenshot to demonstrate the effect of a change.</li>

                    <li>Offer encouragement to group members.</li>

                    <li>Jump in and help other group members who are struggling. Maybe you&rsquo;re great with Excel charts, so help another group member who has little experience with Excel. This is a group project, so it&rsquo;s perfectly okay to trade off tasks. </li>

                    <li>Provide feedback and suggestions to one another. You might realize how a screenshot would help in another section of the report, so tell the other group members what you&rsquo;re thinking.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ol>
