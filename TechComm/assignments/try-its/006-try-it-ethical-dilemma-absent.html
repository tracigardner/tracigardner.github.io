        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Grace Period Reminder</h3>
        <p>Group Discussions have a three-day grace period since group interactions need to take place in a timely manner. The grace period for this Try-It ends at 11:59 PM on September 13, 2023.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">What You Need to Do</h3>
        <p>Read and respond to a workplace scenario that presents an ethical dilemma. In your response address what to do in the situation and suggest strategies to avoid the dilemma in the future. Discuss the posted options, and write a group recommendation that addresses both what to do in the situation and what to do to avoid the situation in the future.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">How This Activity Connects to the Course</h3>
        <p>Ethical considerations matter in everything that you write in the workplace. You may well find yourself in a similar situation once you graduate (or even sooner as an intern). Additionally, you will consider how to proceed if members of your own group are missing when you work on your Teamwork Agreement during Week 7.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Instructions</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Interact with your group in <strong>additional posts</strong> to discuss the solution your group would recommend and the actions Divya&rsquo;s team should take to avoid such dilemmas in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>Post a clear statement</strong> of your group&rsquo;s recommendation at the end of this Discussion.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">The Scenario</h3>
        <div style="margin: 18px 40px;padding: 12px;border: 1px solid #861f41;background-color: #f9f9f9">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>Safety Concerns &amp; The Absent Team Member</strong></h3>
            <p><img style="float: right;margin-left: 12px;" src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/noun-submarine-4612489-yellow.png" alt="Yellow Submarine with the company's name, Hydronautic Technologies on top">Divya Singh leads a five-member team of engineers and scientists who for Hydronautic Technologies, a company that develops robotic submersibles. Divya and her team have been asked to write a first draft of user documentation for a newly-designed submersible, the Makara.</p>

            <p>The company&lsquo;s technical editors will create a second version of the documentation that addresses any issues in corporate style, grammar, and punctuation. The editorial team needs two weeks to complete their work.</p>

            <p>The schedule is very tight. Atlantic Research Associates (ARA), the vendor buying the first Makara ever produced, needs speedy delivery in order to meet their contracts with NOAA. Hydronautic Technologies has contracted to deliver the submersible and related documentation to ARA in three weeks. Because of the potential for future contracts with NOAA are possible, ARA included a clause in the contract with Hydronautic Technologies that penalizes them $10,000 a day for every day late they are in delivery.</p>

            <p>Robin Ryan, the safety expert on Divya&rsquo;s team, is responsible for writing the sections of the user documentation that address three areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-Dive Safety Checks</li>
                <li>Compression &amp; Decompression Procedures</li>
                <li>Submersible Care &amp; Maintenance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These sections are critical to ensuring the safe use of the submersible. Naturally, the Executive Board of Hydronautic Technologies considers the safety of their underwater crafts imperative. As the CEO Dalip Rana says, &ldquo;No one wants to buy a sinking sub!&rdquo;</p>

            <p>The importance of complete and accurate safety information carries additional importance because of the 2023 implosion of OceanGate&rsquo;s <em>Titan</em> submersible. Hydronautic Technologies wants their company to excel as provider of the safest possible underwater research crafts.</p>

            <p>Divya&rsquo;s dilemma is that Robin has unexpectedly gone missing without explanation. No one on the team knows where Robin is and attempts to contact them have been unsuccessful. No one else at Hydronautic Technologies has the specific subject area knowledge on the Makara design. Robin designed the safety devices in the Makara so they are necessary to the complete and accurate composition of the three sections.</p>

            <p>Divya gathers the team together to discuss how they want to proceed in this situation, presenting these possibilities:</p>
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li>Remaining team members complete the documentation without Robin in order to meet the strict deadline for the task. The documentation may not be accurate, but they will deliver it on time.</li>

                <li>Team members postpone the documentation until Robin returns. The documentation will almost certainly be late. It will be accurate, but the company will suffer financial repercussions.</li>

                <li>Team members use the documentation for the company&rsquo;s Nāga submersible, which includes all three sections but describes outdated technology and designs.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The team completes significant revisions to update the Nāga&rsquo;s documentation to match the Makura. They may still miss the deadline, but they will begin with a strong starting place.</li>
                        <li>The team uses the Nāga documentation as is, even though it does not match the Makura&lsquo;s design. They can deliver the documentation on time, but it will be inaccurate. Safety may suffer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Divya asks the team to propose any additional solutions and indicate which option is the best to recommend to the Makura Project Manager.</p>
            <p>What would you suggest if you were a member of Divya&rsquo;s team? What would you suggest that the team do in the future to avoid such situations?</p>
