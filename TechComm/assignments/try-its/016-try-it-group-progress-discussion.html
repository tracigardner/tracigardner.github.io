        <p style="padding: 12px; border: 3px double #861f41; background-color: #fff8dc; font-size: 24px;">You can use the online texts, any notes that you have, and the available course pages in Canvas for help as you work on these questions. You can also talk to one another.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">Grace Period Reminder</h3>
        <p>All Try-Its have a three-day grace period for the rest of the term to ensure that group work goes smoothly.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18pt;">What You Need to Do</h2>
        <p>You&rsquo;ll touch base with the members of your group to let one another know how work on the proposal is proceeding. Your goal in this Discussion is to share details on your work and then to provide support and encouragement to your group members based on their posts.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18pt;">How This Activity Connects to the Course</h2>
        <p>Practically speaking, this Discussion focuses on keeping your group informed on your contributions to the proposal you are collaborating on. Keeping in touch will help ensure that your collaboration goes smoothly.</p>
        <p>Beyond that practical purpose, this Discussion works as an informal progress report. In a few weeks, your group will write a formal progress report to tell me about your work on the Recommendation Report. You&rsquo;re trying out the task of writing a progress report.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18pt;">Assessment</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">I will mark your participation in this Discussion Complete (or Incomplete) after the end of the Grace Period passes. Allow me several days to read and mark all your posts. I will assess group members individually based on their participation. Allow me several days to read and mark your work. </p>

        <h2 style="color: #861f41; font-size: 18pt;">How to Do It</h2>
        <ol class="skipline">
            <li>Read the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/progress-reports-organization" target="_blank">Progress Report: Organization page</a>, looking for details on the information that is customarily included in a progress report.</li>

            <li>If needed, remind yourself of the tasks you are responsible for in your group&rsquo;s proposal by reviewing the Division of Labor for Your Proposal section of your group&rsquo;s Try-It #13: Group Contract, Schedule, & Meeting Minutes.</li>

            <li>Reply to this discussion with an update to your group members on the work you have so far on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/assignments/1835482" target="_blank">Group Proposal for Your Recommendation Report</a>, following these steps:

                <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                    <li id="intro">Begin with an introduction and greeting to your group. The introduction section does not need a heading.</li>

                    <li id="headings">Create headings for these sections of your informal progress report, which follow the introduction:
                        <ul class="null">
                            <li>Work Completed</li>

                            <li><strong>A</strong>lignment of the headings with the body and with one another makes the text easy to read.</li>
                            <li><strong>P</strong>roximity of the headings to the relevant body paragraph(s) will keep the post organized.</li>

                        uses specific, concrete details.
                        organizes the information with subheadings, using these guidelines:
                        Include a brief sentence or two of introduction between your main heading and the first subheading. This sentence can be an advance organizer.
                        Ensure that your subheadings are visibly different from your heading. Typically that are a slightly smaller font than the heading (but still bigger than the font for the paragaphs). They can also be a different color or size.

                    <li id="work-scheduled">Work Scheduled<br />
                        identifies work you still have left to do.
                        introduces the schedule with a simple explanation of the information to follow.
                        includes a Gantt Chart with an updated schedule for the group.
                        concludes with a brief summary of the work that still needs to be done.

        <p>In <strong>your first post</strong>, be sure to mention these things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide a bit of info about yourself (name, major, hometown, hobbies, anything that makes you YOU).</li>
            <li>Talk about your schedule for the term and how you like to work so that you can begin to coordinate your workflows.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In <strong>your second (and additional) posts</strong>, connect with other group members and negotiate how you will work together next week, when we&rsquo;ll have two group Discussions as your Try-Its for the week.</p>
        <p><strong>Optionally</strong>, you can talk about how to inform one another if you&rsquo;ll be offline for several days as well as how to connect if someone isn&rsquo;t responding. Make whatever communication plans you want as a team.</p>




        <ol class="skipline">

            <li>Connect with the members of your group to arrange a meeting time that fits everyone&rsquo;s schedules. You can meet using whatever system works best for your group. Here are some possibilities:
                <ul>
                    <li>Share your sites in a Zoom meeting.</li>

                    <li>Post ideas in a Canvas Group Discussion. The following links can help you:

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Before you meet, review the Group Project Audience Analysis Form, choosing one of the options below:
                <ul class="null" id="audform">
                    <li><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/files/30324774?wrap=1" target="_blank">Download Microsoft Word file</a></li>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Meet with your group as scheduled to arrange the work on this activity. You should be able to assign sections quickly. You can also collaborate during your meeting to fill out the form together.</li>

            <li>Download a copy of the Group Project Audience Analysis Form (see #2 above) for your group to fill in, and upload it to your Project Folder (which you created during Week 7).</li>

            <li>Choose a leader for each section of the form. There are five sections:
                <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;" class="null">

                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>Make any other decisions necessary to ensure that your group fills in all sections of the profile.</li>

            <li>Choose a day and time when group members should have completed their sections so that you can turn your work in.</li>

            <li>Submit your completed file here by one of the following methods:
                <ul>
                    <li>Upload a copy of the file</li>
