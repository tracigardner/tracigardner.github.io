    <h1>Workplace Writing Secrets</h1>
    <p style="padding: 12px; border: 3px double #861f41; background-color: #fff8dc; font-size: 24px;">You can (and should) use your textbook, any notes that you have, and the available course pages in Canvas for help as you work on these questions.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Canvas automatically marks your work Complete when you submit it. All you have to do is TRY the activity. It&rsquo;s okay if you make mistakes. Recognize however that if you have not put in an effort to do the work, I may remove the Complete mark.</p>
   <h2>Question 1</h2>

    <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <p>If I share your workplace writing secret with the class, should I use your name?</p>
<p>I am happy to share your secrets anonymously, but I want to give you the chance to receive public credit if you want. Do not feel pressured to answer &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Your answer will not help or hurt you in the course.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Yes, you may use my first name if you share my workplace writing secret.</li>
        <li>No, publish my workplace writing secret anonymously.</li>
        </ul>
