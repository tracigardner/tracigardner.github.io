        <p>Group Discussions have a three-day grace period since group interactions need to take place in a timely manner. The grace period for this Try-It ends at 11:59 PM on Wednesday, [TBD].</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">What You Need to Do</h3>
        <p>Read and respond to a workplace scenario that presents an ethical dilemma. In your response address what to do in the situation and suggest strategies to avoid the dilemma in the future. Discuss the posted options, and write a group recommendation that addresses both what to do in the situation and what to do to avoid the situation in the future.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#861f41; font-size: 15pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41">How This Activity Connects to the Course</h3>
        <p>Ethical considerations matter in everything that you write in the workplace. You may well find yourself in a similar situation once you graduate (or even sooner as an intern).</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <figure style="float: right;margin-left: 12px;""><img style=" height: 300px;width: 300px;" src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/angel-ethics.png" alt="A Cherokee man who works as a civil engineer works at his computer in an on-site office.

            </figure>
            <p>Angel is the civil engineer at BuildTech. His firm uses EngBot, an AI chatbot, to automate routine correspondence with clients. Before EngBot, the engineers had to write their own correspondence. Now, they can spot-check messages and use their time for other tasks.</p>

            <h2>Scenario</h2>
            <p>Recently, EngBot handled several emotionally-charged communications from clients concerned about project delays, cost overruns, and safety issues. Some clients felt that the AI&rsquo;s responses were impersonal and lacked empathy. One client, in particular, expressed frustration and anger over a delayed project, receiving a response from EngBot that they found dismissive and unhelpful.</p>

            <p>Angel must address these concerns and decide how to respond to the situation. The company&rsquo;s reputation and client trust are at stake, and Angel needs to balance the efficiency benefits of using AI with the ethical responsibility of providing empathetic and appropriate responses, especially in sensitive situations.</p>

            <h2>Options for Angel</h2>
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li><strong>Human Intervention Protocol:</strong> Angel could establish a protocol where emotionally charged or sensitive communications are automatically flagged for human intervention, ensuring that these interactions are handled by the engineer in charge of the client&rsquo;s project.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Responses:</strong> Angel could enhance EngBot&rsquo;s functionality to allow for more personalized responses, including specific language that addresses common client concerns and emotions effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency and Communication:</strong> Angel could enhance transparency by informing clients when they are interacting with an AI and providing clear options for escalating their concerns to human representatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Fire EngBot:</strong> Angel could decide to eliminate EngBot from client communications altogether, returning to a fully human-operated model to ensure empathy and personalized responses in all interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Restrict Negative Responses:</strong> Angel could configure EngBot to only handle neutral or positive communications, automatically routing any negative or emotionally charged messages to human representatives for more sensitive handling.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Issues to Consider as You Decide What Angel Should Do</h2>
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li><strong>AI and Empathy:</strong> How can BuildTech ensure that its AI system responds empathetically to emotionally charged or sensitive client communications? What role does empathy play in client satisfaction?</li>
                <li><strong>Human Intervention:</strong> When should human intervention be prioritized over AI responses in client communication? How can BuildTech effectively balance AI efficiency with the need for human empathy?</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Trust:</strong> How might different approaches to handling sensitive communications impact client trust and the company&rsquo;s reputation?</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Implications:</strong> What are the ethical considerations involved in using AI for handling sensitive client communications? How can Angel ensure that the AI system aligns with the company&rsquo;s ethical standards?</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> How can BuildTech continuously improve its AI system to better handle sensitive communications and adapt to client needs?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Angel faces a critical decision that requires balancing the benefits of AI-driven client communication with the ethical responsibility of providing empathetic and appropriate responses in emotionally charged or sensitive situations. Your discussion should explore the complexities of using AI in client communication, emphasizing the importance of human intervention, empathy, and ethical considerations.</p>
