            <p>Maria is the communications director at Wildlife Guardians International, a nonprofit wildlife conservation association. The organization plans to use Copilot to assist with generating newsletters, social media posts, and donor communications.</p>

            <h2>Scenario</h2>
            <p>Before implementing Copilot, Maria and her team are discussing the ethical implications of using AI to generate and revise messages to donors and stakeholders. They are particularly concerned about whether to disclose the use of AI in their communications. The team understands that transparency is critical, but they also recognize the efficiency benefits that Copilot could bring. They need to draft a policy document that will guide the organization&rsquo;s use of AI in communications, ensuring ethical practices and maintaining donor trust.</p>

            <h2>Options for Maria</h2>
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li><strong>Full Disclosure:</strong> Maria could propose a policy of full disclosure, informing donors and stakeholders whenever AI is used in generating or revising communications. This approach emphasizes transparency and builds trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Partial Disclosure:</strong> Maria could suggest disclosing the use of AI only in specific types of communications (e.g., newsletters or social media posts) while emphasizing that all donor-specific messages are written by humans.</li>
                <li><strong>No Disclosure:</strong> Maria could recommend not disclosing the use of AI at all, arguing that the quality and effectiveness of the communications are what matter most to donors and stakeholders.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Human Review:</strong> Maria could implement a policy where all AI-generated content is reviewed and approved by a human before being sent out, ensuring a balance between AI efficiency and human authenticity.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized AI Acknowledgment:</strong> Maria could create a policy where AI-assisted communications include a brief acknowledgment of the AI&rsquo;s role, framed positively to highlight efficiency and innovation.</li>
                <li><strong>Opt-In Transparency:</strong> Maria could suggest offering an opt-in option for donors and stakeholders, allowing them to choose whether they want to receive communications that may have been generated or assisted by AI.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Integration:</strong> Maria could propose integrating donor and stakeholder feedback to continuously improve AI communications and adjust the policy based on their preferences and concerns.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Questions for Discussion</h2>
            <ul class="skipline">
                <li><strong>Transparency and Trust:</strong> How important is it for Wildlife Guardians to be transparent about the use of AI in its communications with donors and stakeholders? What impact could this transparency have on trust and relationships?</li>
                <li><strong>Perception of Authenticity:</strong> How might donors and stakeholders perceive the authenticity of communications if they know AI is involved? Does the involvement of AI diminish the perceived passion and commitment of the organization?</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Responsibility:</strong> What are the ethical responsibilities of Wildlife Guardians in terms of honesty and transparency with its donors and stakeholders? Where should the line be drawn between efficiency and authenticity?</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Implementation:</strong> How should Wildlife Guardians implement a policy on AI disclosure in communications? What guidelines and practices should be included to ensure clarity and consistency?</li>
                <li><strong>Impact on Donations:</strong> How could the decision to disclose or not disclose the use of AI affect donor behavior and contributions? What factors should be considered in predicting this impact?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Maria and her team face a critical decision that requires balancing the benefits of AI-driven efficiency with the ethical responsibility of transparency and authenticity in donor communications. The discussion should explore the complexities of using AI in nonprofit communications, emphasizing the importance of trust, ethical considerations, and effective policy implementation.</p>
