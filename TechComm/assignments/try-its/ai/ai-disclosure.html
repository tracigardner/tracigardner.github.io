            <p>Maria is the communications director at Wildlife Guardians International, a wildlife conservation nonprofit association. Recently, Wildlife Guardians has started using an AI tool named CommsBot to assist with generating newsletters, social media posts, and donor communications. CommsBot uses natural language processing to create personalized and engaging content quickly, freeing up time for Maria and her team to focus on strategic planning and direct conservation efforts.</p>

            <h2>Scenario</h2>
            <p>Recently, some donors and stakeholders have raised questions about the authenticity of the communications they receive from Wildlife Guardians. They want to know if the heartfelt messages and updates they read are generated by humans who are genuinely passionate about conservation or by an AI tool. Maria is concerned about the ethical implications of not disclosing the use of AI in these communications. While CommsBot has improved efficiency, Maria worries that failing to be transparent might be seen as deceptive and could damage trust with donors and stakeholders.</p>

            <p>Maria and her team need to decide whether to disclose the use of AI in their communications and how to draft a policy document to guide employees at Wildlife Guardians on this matter.</p>

            <h2>Options for Maria</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full Disclosure:</strong> Maria could choose to fully disclose the use of CommsBot in all donor and stakeholder communications, providing transparency about the role of AI in content creation.</li>
                <li><strong>Partial Disclosure:</strong> Maria could disclose the use of AI in specific types of communications (e.g., newsletters or social media posts) while emphasizing that all donor-specific messages are written by humans.</li>
                <li><strong>No Disclosure:</strong> Maria could decide not to disclose the use of AI at all, arguing that the quality and effectiveness of the communications are what matter most to donors and stakeholders.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Human Review:</strong> Maria could implement a policy where all AI-generated content is reviewed and approved by a human before being sent out, ensuring a balance between AI efficiency and human authenticity.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized AI Acknowledgment:</strong> Maria could create a policy where AI-assisted communications include a brief acknowledgment of the AI&rsquo;s role, framed positively to highlight efficiency and innovation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Issues to Consider as You Decide What Maria Should Do</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Transparency and Trust:</strong> How important is it for Wildlife Guardians to be transparent about the use of AI in its communications with donors and stakeholders? What impact could this transparency have on trust and relationships?</li>
                <li><strong>Perception of Authenticity:</strong> How might donors and stakeholders perceive the authenticity of communications if they know AI is involved? Does the involvement of AI diminish the perceived passion and commitment of the organization?</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Responsibility:</strong> What are the ethical responsibilities of Wildlife Guardians in terms of honesty and transparency with its donors and stakeholders? Where should the line be drawn between efficiency and authenticity?</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Implementation:</strong> How should Wildlife Guardians implement a policy on AI disclosure in communications? What guidelines and practices should be included to ensure clarity and consistency?</li>
                <li><strong>Impact on Donations:</strong> How could the decision to disclose or not disclose the use of AI affect donor behavior and contributions? What factors should be considered in predicting this impact?</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Maria and her team face a critical decision that requires balancing the benefits of AI-driven efficiency with the ethical responsibility of transparency and authenticity in donor communications. The discussion should explore the complexities of using AI in nonprofit communications, emphasizing the importance of trust, ethical considerations, and effective policy implementation.</p>
