                <h2>Background</h2>
                <figure style="float: right;margin-left: 12px;""><img style=" height: 300px;width: 300px;" src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/mateo-ethics.png" alt="A Jewish man wearing business casual clothes and glasses sits at his desk in a business office.

                <p>Mateo is a software developer at a mid-sized tech company that has recently started integrating AI tools into their workflow. Previously, developers had to provide documentation notes to technical writers on all projects. The company plans to have AI read the software code and then generate user manuals and documentation, shifting the burden of work away from the developers.</p>
                <p>While the use of AI promises to save time and increase efficiency, Mateo is concerned about their accessibility features, particularly for users with disabilities. Mateo knows that the company has an ethical responsibility to provide equitable access to all users, including those who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies.</p>

                <h2>The Scenario</h2>
                <p>One day, Mateo receives feedback from a visually impaired user who encountered significant issues when trying to access the AI-generated user manual. The text was not properly structured for screen readers, and many images lacked alt text attributes. Mateo needs to decide how to address this issue and ensure that all future documents are accessible to everyone.</p>

                <h2>Options for Mateo</h2>
                <ul class="skipline">
                    <li><strong>Manual Review and Adjustment</strong>: Mateo and his team could manually review and adjust the AI-generated documents to ensure they meet accessibility standards. This would be time-consuming but would ensure that all documents are accessible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Train the AI</strong>: Invest in training the AI tools to recognize and incorporate accessibility features, such as proper structuring for screen readers and adding alt text attributes to images.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implement Accessibility Guidelines</strong>: Develop and implement strict accessibility guidelines that must be followed during the AI generation process and by any human reviewers. This would involve a mix of manual and AI efforts to ensure compliance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek External Expertise</strong>: Hire an external consultant specializing in accessibility to audit the AI-generated documents and recommend improvements. This could provide expert insight but may be costly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Issues to Consider as You Decide What Mateo Should Do</h2>
                <ul class="skipline">
                    <li><strong>Ethical Responsibility</strong>: What are the ethical implications of not providing accessible documents to all users?</li>
                    <li><strong>Balancing Efficiency and Accessibility</strong>: How can the company balance efficiency with the need for accessibility in its documentation?</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk and Benefit Analysis</strong>: What are the potential risks and benefits of each option?</li>
                    <li><strong>Advocacy for Accessibility</strong>: How can Mateo advocate for accessibility within his team and the broader company?</li>
                    <li><strong>Long-term Strategies</strong>: What long-term strategies could the company implement to ensure ongoing accessibility compliance?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Mateo needs to decide how to balance efficiency and accessibility. Each option has its own set of benefits and challenges, and Mateo must consider the ethical implications, potential risks, and long-term impacts of his decision. Ensuring that all users have equitable access to the company&rsquo;s documents is crucial, and Mateo&rsquo;s approach will set a precedent for how the company addresses accessibility in the future.</p>
