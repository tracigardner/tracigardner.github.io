                <figure style="float: right;margin-left: 12px;""><img style=" height: 300px;width: 300px;" src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/winnie-ethics.png" alt="A realistic photo of Winnie, a South African employee of an autonomous vehicle company. On her computer screen are flashy images of autonomous vehicles. She looks at the viewer.">

                </figure>

                <p>Winnie works as a software engineer at Outonoom, an autonomous vehicle company. Recently, an AI-powered autonomous vehicle developed by Outonoom was involved in an accident due to a software error. The accident resulted in injuries to several passengers.</p>
                <p>The incident report generated by the vehicle&rsquo;s AI system was vague and contained misleading information about the cause of the accident, complicating the investigation and delaying the determination of liability and compensation for the injured parties.</p>
                <p>Who is liable for the harm: the developers for the software flaw, the vehicle owners for not understanding the AI&rsquo;s limitations, or the manufacturer for deploying the technology without exhaustive safety checks?</p>

                <h4>Scenario</h4>
                <p>As a key member of the software development team, Winnie has access to the detailed logs and data from the vehicle&rsquo;s systems. She discovers that the AI report inaccurately represents the software error, potentially shielding Outonoom from liability.</p>
                <p>Winnie is now faced with a dilemma: Should she disclose the true cause of the accident, which could harm the company&rsquo;s reputation and her career, or should she remain silent, allowing the investigation to proceed based on the misleading report?</p>

                <h4>Options for Winnie</h4>
                <ul class="skipline">
                    <li><strong>Full Disclosure:</strong> Report the accurate findings to the investigation team, ensuring transparency and accountability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal Report:</strong> Inform her supervisor about the discrepancy and recommend a corrected report be submitted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anonymous Tip:</strong> Provide the true information anonymously to the investigators to avoid direct repercussions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek Advice:</strong> Consult with a legal or ethical advisor within the company about the best course of action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do Nothing:</strong> Remain silent and allow the investigation to continue with the misleading report.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Issues to Consider as You Decide What Winnie Should Do</h4>
                <ul class="skipline">
                    <li><strong>Responsibility to Truth:</strong> How important is it for Winnie to ensure the investigation has accurate information?</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional Ethics:</strong> What are Winnie&rsquo;s ethical obligations as a software engineer in this situation?</li>
                    <li><strong>Company Reputation:</strong> How might disclosing the error impact Outonoom&rsquo;s reputation and future business?</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Repercussions:</strong> What are the potential consequences for Winnie&rsquo;s career if she discloses the information?</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Implications:</strong> Are there any legal risks associated with either disclosing or withholding the true cause of the accident?</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Winnie faces a challenging ethical decision that balances her responsibility to provide accurate information, the potential impact on her company and career, and the legal implications of her actions. What should she do? Who should the company say is responsible for the harm?</p>
