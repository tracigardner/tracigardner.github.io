                <p>Stellarama, an aerospace engineering firm, has implemented advanced AI-generation tools to assist with technical and scientific writing. However, these tools are only available to full-time employees. The company justifies this decision based on financial considerations and the frequent turnover of part-time employees and interns. This policy has caused concern among part-time employees and interns, who feel they are at a disadvantage and are unable to perform their tasks as effectively as their full-time counterparts.</p>

                <h2>Scenario</h2>
                <p>Priten, a part-time technical writer at Stellarama, is working with a team of part-time employees and interns on drafting a report to managers. The report argues that equitable access to AI tools should be granted to all employees and interns, regardless of their employment status. Priten is tasked with leading the drafting process and must decide how to present the team's case to the managers. He is aware of the potential risks the company faces by limiting access to these tools, including reduced quality and efficiency in technical writing tasks, potential demotivation among part-time staff, reduced opportunities for skill development, exclusion from innovation, and inconsistent quality of work.</p>

                <h2>Options for Priten</h2>
                <ul class="skipline">
                    <li><strong>Advocate Strongly:</strong> Priten can advocate strongly for the team&rsquo;s position, emphasizing the ethical implications and the potential risks to the company&rsquo;s work quality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Propose a Pilot Program:</strong> Priten can propose a pilot program that grants temporary access to AI tools for part-time employees and interns, showcasing the benefits through measurable outcomes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Suggest a Compromise:</strong> Priten can suggest a compromise where limited AI tool access is granted based on project needs or tenure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gather More Data:</strong> Priten can gather more data and feedback from the team to strengthen the report, potentially delaying the presentation but ensuring a more robust argument.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek External Support:</strong> Priten can seek support from external industry experts or organizations to back the teamâ€™s argument for equitable access to AI tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Highlight Success Stories:</strong> Priten can highlight success stories from other companies that have implemented equitable access to AI tools to demonstrate potential benefits and positive outcomes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Issues to Consider as You Decide What Priten Should Do</h2>
                <ul class="skipline">
                    <li><strong>Impact on Quality:</strong> How might the lack of access to AI tools impact the quality and efficiency of technical and scientific writing among part-time employees and interns?</li>
                    <li><strong>Employee Morale:</strong> What effect does unequal access to tools have on the morale and motivation of part-time employees and interns?</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial Justification:</strong> How valid are the company&rsquo;s financial concerns regarding the provision of AI tools to part-time employees and interns?</li>
                    <li><strong>Long-term Benefits:</strong> What are the potential long-term benefits to Stellarama if equitable access to AI tools is provided to all employees?</li>
                    <li><strong>Managerial Support:</strong> How can Priten garner support from managers and full-time employees to advocate for equitable access to AI tools?</li>
                    <li><strong>Skill Development:</strong> How does limited access to AI tools affect opportunities for skill development among part-time employees and interns?</li>
                    <li><strong>Innovation Exclusion:</strong> How does restricting access to AI tools exclude part-time employees and interns from participating in innovative processes?</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency of Work:</strong> What are the implications of inconsistent quality of work due to unequal access to AI tools?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Priten faces a challenging decision in advocating for equitable access to AI tools at Stellarama. The team&rsquo;s effectiveness and the quality of their technical writing depend on having the same resources as their full-time counterparts. By carefully considering the options and issues, Priten can craft a compelling argument that highlights the benefits of providing these tools to all employees, potentially leading to a more inclusive and efficient workplace.</p>
