        <p>Read and respond to a workplace scenario that presents an ethical dilemma in at least two Discussion posts. In your response, address what you would do in the situation and suggest strategies to avoid the dilemma in the future. Discuss the posted options with your group, and write a group recommendation that addresses what to do in the situation. Use the step-by-step instructions below to complete the task.</p>

        <p>Ethical considerations matter in everything that you write in the workplace. You may well find yourself in a situation similar to this scenario once you graduate (or even sooner as an intern). This scenario focuses on the autonomy of workers, in this case writers, when AI is also being used in the workplace.</p>

                    <p>Ramón is a senior technical writer at CodeCraft, a software development company known for its innovative products and cutting-edge technology. Recently, CodeCraft integrated a generative AI tool called DocuGen into its documentation process. DocuGen uses natural language processing and machine learning to create comprehensive software documentation, including user manuals, API guides, and troubleshooting instructions.</p>

                        Ramón and his team have been using DocuGen for a few months, and it has dramatically increased their productivity. The AI tool can produce initial drafts of documentation much faster than human writers, allowing the team to focus on refining and adding nuanced details. However, Ramón has noticed several issues with the AI-generated documentation:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="skipline">
                        <li>The AI sometimes includes outdated or incorrect information, which requires careful review and correction.</li>
                        <li>Ramón is concerned about the loss of the team&rsquo;s unique writing style and the potential decline in the overall quality and clarity of the documentation.</li>
                        <li>The documentation team values their ability to make independent decisions and take responsibility for their work. They fear that AI is challenging their autonomy.</li>
                        <li>Some team members are worried about their job security as the reliance on AI increases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        During a project review meeting, the product manager proposes that the company fully transition to using DocuGen for all documentation needs, citing cost savings and increased efficiency.Ramón is asked to provide his input on the proposal.
