                <p>Hayes &amp; Daughters is an environmentally-friendly company that produces household cleaning supplies, scented hand and body products, and scented candles. The company plans to launch an AI technology system to monitor social media for references to its brand and products.</p>

                <p>The company hopes the new system will help them respond quickly to customer questions or complaints and share news and information that will help market their products. This initiative aims to improve customer engagement and satisfaction, while also enhancing the company&rsquo;s public image.</p>

                <h4>Scenario</h4>
                <p>Cameron is a member of the committee writing a recommendation report on how Hayes &amp; Daughters should inform customers about the way they are analyzing and using public posts. At the next committee meeting, Cameron must recommend how transparent the company should be with its customers and whether it is necessary to inform the public at all.</p>

                <h4>Options for Cameron</h4>
                <ul class="skipline">
                    <li><strong>Full Transparency:</strong> Recommend that Hayes &amp; Daughters fully disclose their AI monitoring practices, including how data is collected, analyzed, and used, ensuring complete openness with customers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Disclosure:</strong> Suggest providing general information about AI monitoring practices without revealing specific details, balancing transparency with protecting proprietary methods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proactive Engagement:</strong> Recommend actively engaging with customers about the AI monitoring practices through regular updates, Q&A sessions, and educational content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimal Disclosure:</strong> Advise the company to disclose only the essential information required by law, keeping most details about the AI monitoring practices confidential.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Disclosure:</strong> Propose that Hayes &amp; Daughters do not inform the public about their AI monitoring practices, focusing on internal use and proprietary advantage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Issues to Consider as You Decide What Cameron Should Recommend</h4>
                <ul class="skipline">
                    <li><strong>Customer Trust:</strong> How will the level of transparency impact customer trust and the company&rsquo;s reputation?</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> What are the legal requirements for disclosing AI monitoring practices in the industry and region?</li>
                    <li><strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> How might full transparency affect the company&rsquo;s competitive advantage and proprietary information?</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethical Responsibilities:</strong> What are the ethical implications of monitoring customer interactions without their explicit knowledge?</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact on Engagement:</strong> How will different levels of transparency affect customer engagement and interaction with the brand?</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Cameron must decide how to balance transparency with the company&rsquo;s need to protect proprietary methods and maintain a competitive edge.What should she recommend to promote trust, ethical responsibility, and effective customer engagement?</p>
