        <p>I have added feedback on all of the Group Progress Report Assignment submitted by Sunday, November 10. </p>

        <p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll share details on what to do if you or your group have an Incomplete on the project. I will also comment on your work generally, and suggest what you can do to improve your project if I asked you to revise. Some tips will also apply to the Recommendation Report.</p>

        <h2>If You Have an Incomplete Because You Did Not Contribute</h2>
        <p>If you have an incomplete marked for your Group Progress Report Assignment because you did not contribute to the group&rsquo;s work, you fall into one of these two possible situations:</p>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li>
                <strong>Your group submitted a progress report that earned an Incomplete</strong><br>
                If you fall into this category, you may still be able to earn a Complete. Talk to your group about participating in the revision of the progress report. Your group members will discuss your request and decide what to do next.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Your group submitted a progress report that earned a Complete</strong><br>
                If you fall into this category, your Incomplete stands. Since the progress report is finished, there&rsquo;s no way for you to contribute at this point. Be sure that you connect with your group and participate in the work on the recommendation report.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>If Your Entire Group Has an Incomplete</h2>
        <p>If everyone in your group has an Incomplete marked for the Group Progress Report Assignment, you can still earn a Complete on the project. You fall into one of these two possible situations:</p>

        <ul class="skipline">
            <li>
                <strong>If the group&rsquo;s project was marked Incomplete and reassigned<br>
                </strong>Collaborate with your group to revise the progress report. Everyone in the group should work to improve the project, adding whatever is missing or revising the information to include more (or accurate) details. Resubmit your project, and I will review your work again.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>If the group did not submit the progress report at all</strong><br>
                It is not too late. Collaborate with your group to compose your progress report. Submit your progress report, and I will give you feedback.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Group Progress Report Assignment has a <strong>grace period that ends at 11:59 PM on Friday, December 6</strong>. You have until the end of the grace period, but completing the work sooner will help ensure that you have time to work on the other assignments in the course.</p>

        <h2>General Feedback</h2>
        <p>I have included comments on every group&rsquo;s drafts. Use this documentation from Canvas for help finding the notes on your drafts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-assignment-comments-from-my-instructor/ta-p/283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How do I view assignment comments from my instructor?</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-download-assignment-submissions-from-all-my-courses/ta-p/298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How do I download assignment submissions from all my courses?<span aria-hidden="true" title="Links to an external site."> </span></a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>I did <em>not</em> fill out the rubric for the progress reports.</p>
        <details>
            <summary class="btn btn-primary" role="button" style="background-color: #e5e1e6;border: 1px solid #75787b;color: #333333;text-align: center;text-decoration: none;border-radius: 9px;">Show/Hide the TL;DR on Why</summary>
            <div id="reveal" class="maroonbox" style="margin-top: 15px;margin-left: 36px;margin-right: 36px;background-color: #efefef;">
                <p>Canvas lets me send comments to everyone in the group, but it doesn&rsquo;t have a way to fill out the rubric once and send it to everyone in the group. That means that I would have to complete the rubric in exactly the same way four or five times for each group. That&rsquo;s a lot of unneeded busywork, so I just added comments to your progress reports and the longer comment in the sidebar.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <h2>Specific Feedback</h2>
        <p>Use these tips as you revise (or compose) your progress report. These are the errors that I saw most frequently as I read your work. Note that many of these suggestions will apply to your recommendation report as well.</p>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li><strong>Meet the requirements of the assignment.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Include every section outlined in the assignment</strong> (listed under the &ldquo;Collaborating to Write Your Progress Report&rdquo; section in Step 1).</li>

                    <li><strong>Provide all of the details explained for each of the sections.</strong> The list under Step 1 tells you the information each section must include. Be sure you have it all in your document.</li>

                    <li><strong>Use memo format for your progress report.</strong> For help, see the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/correspondence-memo-components" target="_blank">Correspondence: Memo Components page</a>.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Use the example progress report.</strong> To see what your progress report should look like and the kind of information that it should include, check out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gTznC2baBCNDM3LRyLjfofkTqC_1v3Ovsn9chvQcZjg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Progress Report on Apricot Ocelot Website Analysis</a>.</li>

            <li><strong>Proofread and spellcheck your work.</strong> No workplace wants to send out documents that are full of typos. Review your work to make sure you catch these errors.</li>

            <li><strong>Get help from the Writing Center (optional).</strong> Anyone can visit the Writing Center in the library for help with projects for the course. Writing Center tutors can help you strengthen your content as well as work on document design and other issues. You can read more about the Writing Center and make an appointment on the <a href="https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Writing Center&rsquo;s webpage</a>.</li>
