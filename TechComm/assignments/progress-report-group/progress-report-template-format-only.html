        <p>The template below shows the layout and formatting of the Progress Report. This is the general layout and format your project should have. Your information will have different lengths and content, but it should have the same basic look and feel. Note these important details:</p>

        <ul class="skipline">
            <li>The document is missing page numbers. Your PDF memo should have page numbers (either at the top of each page or the bottom of each page).</li>

            <li>Finally, the names in the memo are all fake.</li>
            <li>The Gantt Chart included is a general representation, made with ChatGPT.</li>
        </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 12px;">This memo provides an update on our work from March 5 through April 11, including specific details on the work that has been completed and the work that is scheduled for the rest of the project.</p>

            <p>Our group is analyzing the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/26184-h/26184-h.htm" target="_blank"><em>Simple Sabotage Field Manual</em></a>.&rdquo; and writing a recommendation report that will explain how the company can improve the site&rsquo;s readability, accessibility, and document design.</p>

            <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Work Completed</h3>

            <p>So far, our group has analyzed the Manual and addressed the structure of our recommended revisions.</p>
            <h4>Manual Analysis</h4>
            <p>During the first weeks on the project (March 5 to April 1), we analyzed the Manual and went over every page to check for consistency and quality. Every observation was recorded in a report in Google Docs. In the same document, we have solutions for each problem or ideas on how to improve the situation.</p>

            <p>This Google Doc gives us a single place to brainstorm and try to solve the problems we found. This list is what we are going to reference for our recommendation in the report. They will be expanded as appropriate and researched in more depth if they make it into our final report.</p>

            <h4>Revision Structure</h4>
            <p>For our recommendation report, we all worked on getting the structure set in the last week (April 5 to 11). We created a basic wireframe of what we need to do and fill out for the near future. From this we all talked about what needs to be done for each section and who is best fit to work on it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Intro & Front Matter: Alex is in charge of organizing and writing these sections.</li>
                <li>Body: Kai and Priya will focus on collecting the information for the body for the report including introduction, methods, results, and conclusions.</li>
                <li>Recommendations, Back Matter, & Visuals: Omar will write the remaining portions of the report and create all visuals and diagrams for the document.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Work Scheduled</h3>

            <h4>Preliminary Drafting</h4>
            <p>Preliminary drafting will focus on sections of the report that must be complete before other portions can be written. Specifically, the body of the report must be written before portions of the Front and Back Matter can be written.</p>
            <p>While Kai and Priya focus on writing these sections, Alex and Omar will help by finding supporting research and creating supporting visuals and diagrams for the body of the report.</p>
            <p>We plan for this work to be completed by Friday, April 18.</p>

            <h4>Completing Drafting</h4>
            <p>With preliminary drafting complete, Alex and Omar will develop the recommendations section as well as the front and back matter. Kai and Priya will further develop the body sections, incorporating materials that Alex and Omar have provided.</p>

            <p>We plan for this work to be completed by Thursday, April 24.</p>

            <h4>Revision and Editing</h4>
            <p>All members of the team will read the complete draft carefully from Friday, April 25 to Sunday, April 27. Members will focus particularly in reading sections they did not write to ensure that their own work is represented accurately and ensuring consistency among the sections.</p>

            <p>As an example, Kai and Priya will ensure the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure that all the sections and subsections in the body are accurately included in the Table of Contents.</li>
                <li>Check whether the technical details that the Web Development Team needs are included in the Abstract.</li>
                <li>Confirm that all relevant information the Management Team will need is included in the Executive Summary.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Our team will use the remaining time in the schedule (Monday, April 28 to Tuesday, April 29) revising the document as necessary, based on the comments and recommendations the team has gathered. We&rsquo;ll make a final editing pass through the document on Tuesday, April 29</p>

            <p>We plan for this Revision and Editing work to be completed by Tuesday, April 29, the Target Due Date for the project.</p>

            <h4>Schedule for Work</h4>
            <p>All work on the project must be completed by Tuesday, April 29, following the schedule shown in the Gantt Chart on the following page:</p>

                </figure>
            </div>

            <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>We have no concerns about completing our report by the target due date. We are all working well as a group and are confident that the remaining work will flow smoothly. You can access our working Google Docs at [link to google drive documents was here].</p>

            <p>Our team looks forward to hearing your feedback on our progress. If you have any questions about our completed or scheduled work, please connect with our team leader, Priya, at priyakapoor@vt.edu or 540-555-1872.</p>
