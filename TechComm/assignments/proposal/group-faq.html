            <dt>Will group memebers be assigned?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, groups were set up the second week of the course.</dd>

            <dt>How many members will be in each group?</dt>
            <dd>Groups are 4&ndash;5 members each.</dd>

            <dt>Will you assign team leaders?</dt>
            <dd>No. I will ask groups to assign leaders. The best I could do is choose randomly. I ask you to choose so that you have someone willing and able to do the job.</dd>

            <dt>Are groups the same for all the group assignments?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, I want you to develop working collaboration, so more time with the same people will help you adjust to overcome any challenges.</dd>

            <dt>Do the group projects have an impact on our course grades?</dt>
            <dd>Of course. You need to both participate fully in the group projects and earn a Complete on the group projects.</dd>

            <dt>Will everyone in the group get the same grade?</dt>
            <dd>The documents will either be marked Complete or Incomplete. Everyone in the group will receive the same mark. If the group project is Incomplete, the group can revise and resubmit as long at the end of the grace period has not passed.</dd>

            <dt>Is there a group member grading system?</dt>
            <dd>This course has no grades other than the course grade at the end; therefore, there is no grading system. Group members will, however, have the opportunity to provide feedback on one another&rsquo;s work.</dd>

            <dt>Do we have to coordinate a time for meetings?</dt>
            <dd>You can if you want to. Your group will decide how you want to meet and work together.</dd>

            <dt>Will there be any mandatory meetings set up?</dt>
            <dd>I will not set up mandatory meetings. Your group can however. The goal of the tasks is to learn about project management as it relates to collaborative writing. You need to make the decisions and evaluate how they work.</dd>

            <dt>How does a group project work in an asynchronous course?</dt>
            <dd>Your group can decide how to collaborate based on your schedules and what works best for you. You can meet in person or on Zoom. Your whole group can meet, and you can also have smaller meetings with two or three people. You can also use the resources in Canvas Discussions to connect.</dd>

            <dt>How many times a week do you recommend for groups to meet?</dt>
            <dd>I believe that groups will benefit from at least meeting once a week to arrange work, update one another, and address any challenges that come up. You can meet more than that if you want.</dd>

            <dt>Are we able to adjust the work schedule and group assignments after?</dt>
            <dd>Of course. Your group decides what kind of meetings and schedule work for everyone involved. You&rsquo;re in control.</dd>

            <dt>How will we contact group members?</dt>
            <dd>You can choose whatever will work best for the members of your group. Your group can exchange email addresses, and you can connect in Canvas Discussions. If you want, you can exchange cell numbers so you can text one another or set up a GroupMe for your group.</dd>

            <dt>How will the group share documents?</dt>
            <dd>I recommend Google Drive, primarily because it is what I use the most. If you are used to sharing work with Office 365, that&rsquo;s fine too. I just can&rsquo;t help much with Office because I haven&rsquo;t used it.</dd>

            <dt>How long will the group projects take?</dt>
            <dd>You can check the Target Due Dates on the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2023-08-Fall/ShortGuide2TW-Fall23.pdf#page=4" target="_blank">Short Course Schedul</a>e to see the amount of time for each.</dd>

            <dt>Will the group collaborate on projects, or will we each write our own report?</dt>
            <dd>These are group projects, so everyone will collaborate to write and submit a single document for each of the projects. For instance, your group will collaborate to write and submit a proposal.</dd>

            <dt>What Major Projects will we write as a group?</dt>
            <dd>The Major Projects are all listed in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/discussion_topics/1700429" target="_blank">How You&rsquo;ll Collaborate This Term Announcement</a>.</dd>

            <dt>What should groups do if a member does not respond to email or messages in Canvas?</dt>
            <dd>Your group can decide on the general methods when you begin collaborating. That might be a phone call to check on anyone who is missing. Start from assuming everyone means well, so check on people before the project. If you continue to be unable to contact the person, your group can contact me in Canvas Inbox.</dd>

            <dt>When should we be concerned about a missing student?</dt>
            <dd>If someone is missing for a day, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it. Everyone has a bad day from time to time. If the person is missing a week or more, you definitely need to let me know.</dd>

            <dt>What should groups do if a member does not contribute to the documents?</dt>
            <dd>Your group can decide how to deal with this situation as well. For example, your group can negotiate with the person, outlining what they need to do to catch up. If you decide to contact me, the group members should all agree (except the member who is not contributing, of course). Additionally, the group should send me one message in Canvas Inbox.</dd>

            <dt>How will poor or missing work from one group member impact the grade for the project?</dt>
            <dd>Remember that documents will either be marked Complete or Incomplete. Everyone in the group will receive the same mark. In the case of a group member who does not participate at all or participates only minimally, that person will receive an Incomplete.</dd>

            <dt>Will each group member have a specific page count to complete?</dt>
            <dd>I won&rsquo;t set up any page counts. I don&rsquo;t set up page counts for the documents either. I give you a typical range that describes (but does not prescribe) the length. Length depends upon what you have to say, your document design, your use of graphics and illustrations, and other document elements. </dd>

            <dt>How can we ensure work is evenly divided among group members?</dt>
            <dd>asdfs</dd>

            <dt>How should groups deal with disagreements among members?</dt>
            <dd>asdfasdf</dd>
