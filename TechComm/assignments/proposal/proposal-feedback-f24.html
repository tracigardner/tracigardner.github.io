        <p>I have added feedback on all of the Group Proposal Assignment submitted by Saturday, November 2. </p>

        <p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll share details on what to do if you or your group have an Incomplete on the project. I will also comment on your work generally, and suggest what you can do to improve your project if I asked you to revise. Some tips will also apply to the Recommendation Report.</p>

        <h2>If You Have an Incomplete Because You Did Not Contribute</h2>

        <p>If your group earned a Complete and you did not participate in the work, your Incomplete stands. Since the proposal is finished, there&rsquo;s no way for you to contribute at this point. Be sure that you connect with your group and participate in the work on the Progress Report and the Recommendation Report.</p>

        <h2>If Your Entire Group Has an Incomplete</h2>
        <p>If everyone in your group has an incomplete marked for the Group Proposal Assignment, you can still earn a Complete on the project. You fall into one of these two possible situations:</p>

        <ul class="skipline">
            <li>
                <strong>If the group&rsquo;s project was marked Incomplete and reassigned<br>
                </strong>Collaborate with your group to revise the proposal. Everyone in the group should work to improve the project, adding whatever is missing or revising the information to include more (or accurate) details. Resubmit your project, and I will review your work again.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>If the group did not submit the proposal at all</strong><br>
                It is not too late. Collaborate with your group to compose your proposal. Submit your proposal, and I will give you feedback.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Group Proposal Assignment has a <strong>grace period that ends at 11:59 PM on Friday, December 6</strong>. You have until the end of the grace period, but completing the work sooner will help ensure that you have time to work on the other assignments in the course.</p>

        <h2>General Feedback</h2>
        <p>I have included comments on every group&rsquo;s drafts. Use this documentation from Canvas for help finding the notes on your drafts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-assignment-comments-from-my-instructor/ta-p/283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How do I view assignment comments from my instructor?</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-download-assignment-submissions-from-all-my-courses/ta-p/298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How do I download assignment submissions from all my courses?<span aria-hidden="true" title="Links to an external site."> </span></a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>There is No Feedback in the Rubric for the Assignment</h2>
        <p>I did <em>not</em> fill out the rubric for the proposals because Canvas does not share the rubric with all members of the group. That means that I would have to complete the rubric in exactly the same way four or five times for each group. That&rsquo;s a lot of unneeded busywork, so I just added comments to your proposals and the longer comment in the sidebar. Check the Comments to see what (if anything) you need to pay attention to as you work on future projects.</p>

        <h2>Specific Feedback</h2>
        <p>Use these tips as you revise (or compose) your proposal. These are the errors that I saw most frequently as I read your work. Note that many of these suggestions will apply to your recommendation report as well.</p>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li><strong>Meet the requirements of the assignment.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Include every section outlined in the assignment</strong> (listed under the &ldquo;Collaborating to Write Your Proposal&rdquo; section in Step 1).</li>

                    <li><strong>Provide all of the details explained for each of the sections.</strong> The list under Step 1 tells you the information each section must include. Be sure you have it all in your document.</li>

                    <li><strong>Use memo format for your proposal.</strong> For help, see the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/correspondence-memo-components" target="_blank">Correspondence: Memo Components page</a>.</li>

                    <li><strong>Follow the guidelines for the use of images</strong>. Check out the details under the &ldquo;Collaborating to Write Your Proposal&rdquo; section in Step 3. In particular, be sure that you avoid purely decorative images and that you integrate the visual in the text of the proposal. See the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/visual-aids-integrating-visuals-into-your-text" target="_blank">Visual Aids: Integrating Visuals into Your Text</a> page for help.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Differentiate between the audiences involved.</strong> Your Recommendation Report is addressed to a specific person, the individual who will determine whether to follow your recommendations. The other audience you may refer to in your work is the audience for the website you are analyzing. That is a very different group. Be sure that you talk about the decision-maker in your proposal&rsquo;s Project Audience section.</li>

            <li><strong>Compose your proposal in chunked paragraphs</strong>. You can use supporting lists, but you should not use <em>only</em> lists. Look at either of the example proposals listed on <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/assignments/2126918" target="_blank">the assignment page</a> to see what the document should look like.</li>

            <li><strong>Link to websites that you mention.</strong> Ever read an email and the writer mentions a website that relates to the message? What&rsquo;s one of the first things you probably need to do? Visit that website. What&rsquo;s the most annoying thing to find next in that email? That the writer didn&rsquo;t give you a link so you could view the website! Make your reader&rsquo;s experience positive: give them clickable links to any website you refer to.</li>

            <li><strong>Proofread and spellcheck your work.</strong> No workplace wants to send out documents that are full of typos. Review your work to make sure you catch these errors.</li>

            <li><strong>Get help from the Writing Center (optional).</strong> Anyone can visit the Writing Center in the library for help with projects for the course. Writing Center tutors can help you strengthen your content as well as work on document design and other issues. You can read more about the Writing Center and make an appointment on the <a href="https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Writing Center&rsquo;s webpage</a>.</li>
