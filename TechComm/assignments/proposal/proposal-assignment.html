        <p>
            You and the members of your group will compose a proposal to write a recommendation report for improvements to a website, chosen by the group. Each group member will share their Usability Revision and Reflection with the members of your group, and then the group will choose one of the sites to focus on.</p>
        <p>In addition to telling me about the site your groups has chosen, your proposal will provide a schedule for your work on the recommendation report, including plans for group meetings and draft deadlines. It will also identify the responsibilities of all group members.</p>

        <h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
        <p>For our course, I want you to provide your group&rsquo;s topic and plan for the Recommendation Report. Your proposal will give me the chance to help you are you move on to writing your Recommendation Report as well as give your group the opportunity to make preliminary decisions that will be important to your success.</p>
        <p>Beyond this course, research proposals are common features in academia. Before a PhD, MA, or MFA candidate begins work on a dissertation or thesis, for example, they will submit to a committee of readers a well-developed plan for that research document. Additionally, in many technical and scientific courses&mdash;but even in humanities ones&mdash;an upper-division research project is often preceded by such a proposal.

        <ol class="skipline" id="howyoudoit">
            <li>Review the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/proposal-criteria" target="_blank">Proposal Criteria</a> and the example proposals linked in the previous section to understand the requirements for the project.</li>
            <li id="choose-site">Choose the website that your group will focus on for the Recommendation Report, following these guidelines:
                <ul class="null">
                    <li>Have each group member compare the site that they used for the User Documentation Revision and Reflection Memo to the </li>
                    <li>Select a webpage or PDF that you are familiar with to make the project easier.</li>
                    <li>Choose a webpage or PDF that you can improve in terms of usability.</li>
                    <li>Do not choose any webpage or PDF that I (Traci) have written. That gets weird.</li>
                </ul>
                Some example documents you can use are as follows:
                <ul class="null">
                    <li>an assignment provided in a class at VT</li>
                    <li>online help files or troubleshooting documents</li>
                    <li>directions to access or complete a procedure, such as a user manual or user guide</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Make a backup of the website your group chooses. Websites and online files can change frequently. By saving a backup, you&rsquo;ll avoid the situation where the page changes while you are drafting. If that happens, the information in your project (the answers you provide) can change. Here are some ways to make a backup:
                <ul class="null">
                    <li>Print out the webpage on paper, ensuring all the information on the page prints.</li>
                    <li>Print the webpage and choose to print a PDF, so you&rsquo;ll have a digital backup.</li>
                    <li>Save a backup to the Wayback Machine by <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/" title="Instructions to save a page on the Wayback Machine" target="_blank">following these instructions</a>.</li>

                            <li>Design<br>
                                Apply design principles (<a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/crap-design-principles" target="_blank">CRAP</a>, color, white space, etc.). Use a title and internal headings, as well as lists (when needed).</li>

                                As long as it needs to be in order to be an easy-to-read, easy-to-use document.</li>
                            <li>Ethical Considerations<br>
                                Revise any content that misleads, pressures, or coerces the reader into thinking or doing something. Examine how people with disabilities are talked about, and adjust if necessary. Consider whether the content is inclusive, and broaden it as needed.</li>
                            <li>Legal Considerations<br>
                                Ensure disclaimers and policies are clear and legible. Verify that citations are used properly in the document.</li>
                            <li>Cultural Considerations<br>
                                Are there multiple readers of this document? Does the content need to be modified for international readers? Are there cultural issues that could be addressed or avoided? (Respond to these and more, if applicable to your chosen document.)</li>
