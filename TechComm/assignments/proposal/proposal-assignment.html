        <p>You and your group will propose the topic for your persuasive recommendation report, which will focus on improvements to a website. In addition to telling me about the website your group has chosen, your proposal will outline details on your project and your group, including a research plan and project timetable.</p>

        <h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
        <p>For our course, I want you to provide your group&rsquo;s topic and plan for the Recommendation Report. Your proposal will give me the chance to ensure your plans will work before you move on to writing your Recommendation Report as well as give your group the opportunity to make preliminary decisions that will be important to your success.</p>
        <p>Beyond this course, research proposals are common features in academia. Before a PhD, MA, or MFA candidate begins work on a dissertation or thesis, for example, they will submit to a committee of readers a well-developed plan for that research document. Additionally, in many technical and scientific courses&mdash;but even in humanities ones&mdash;an upper-division research project is often preceded by such a proposal.</p>
        <p>Finally, in the workplace, proposals are a common way to pitch potential ideas for development, projects to potential clients, and possible changes to company processes, equipment, and procedures.</p>

        <h2>The Scenario for the Project</h2>
        <div style="background-color: #fff8dc;border: 1px solid #dedede;padding: 24px;">
            <p>You work as a Usability Consultant at a <span style="font-weight: 600;"><span style="color: #861f41;">Maroon</span> <span style="font-size: 18px;">&#43;</span> <span style="color: #e5751f;">Orange</span> Digital</span>, where I (Traci) work as a Founding Owner and the Director of Project Development. I&rsquo;ve asked you and several other people (your project group) to collaborate on a project proposal to improve the usability of an existing website.</p>

            <p>Your job as a group is to identify a potential client who owns or manages an online website and then develop a proposal that describes how our consulting company can improve the site. You&rsquo;ll follow the instructions below in the &ldquo;How to Do It&rdquo; section.</p>

            <p>Because you&rsquo;ve never written a proposal before, I gave you this description of the purpose of a proposal to help you and your group collaborate:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                    A proposal should contain information that would enable the audience of that proposal [That's me&mdash;Traci] to decide whether to approve the project, to approve or hire you to do the work, or both. To write a successful proposal, put yourself in the place of your audience—the recipient of the proposal—and think about what sorts of information that person would need in order to feel confident having you complete the project.</p>

            </blockquote>
        </div>


        <h2>How You Do It</h2>

        <p>Follow the instructions in the four sections below to</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose a website that the group will analyze.</li>
            <li>Plan the work and schedule your group will follow to write the proposal.</li>
            <li>Write the proposal collaboratively.</li>
            <li>Review the proposal draft and revise/proofread as necessary.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #861f41;">Step 2: Planning the Work and Schedule for Your Proposal</h3>
        <ol id="planning" class="skipline">
            <li id="site-backup">Make a <strong>backup of the website</strong> your group has chosen. One group member can make the backup of all the pages and then share the links or files with the rest of the group. Here are some ways to make a backup:
                <ul class="null">
                    <li>Print out the webpages on paper, ensuring all the information on the page prints.</li>

                    <li>Print the webpages as PDFs, so you&rsquo;ll have a digital backup. You can <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-upload-a-file-to-a-group/ta-p/278" target="_blank">upload the PDFs to Files in your Group area on Canvas</a>.</li>

                    <li>Save a backup to the Wayback Machine by <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/" title="Instructions to save a page on the Wayback Machine" target="_blank">following these instructions</a>.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Decide on the roles</strong> that each of you will take on in the group. Each of you must be responsible for at least one job. Use the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/pages/group-roles" target="_blank">Group Roles</a> page for help identifying roles.</li>

            <li>Use the information in the readings and <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/pages/proposal-criteria" target="_blank">Proposal Criteria</a> to <strong>divide the work for your group&rsquo;s proposal</strong>, considering the <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/group-writing#:~:text=just%20written%20text%3F-,Drafting/writing,-Separately%20(each%20group" target="_blank">two basic ways to work.</a>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Plan your group schedule</strong> for the rest of the term&mdash;including draft due dates, meetings, and status updates&mdash;with one another. Here are some tips:
                <ul id="schedule-tips" class="null">
                    <li>Create your schedule to finish the Proposal by the Target Due Date. If your group gets down to the last minute and needs to use the Checkpoint Deadline, that&rsquo;s fine; but plan to be on time.</li>
                    <li>As you plan your project timeline, pay attention to the way that sections of the Recommendation Report rely upon one another. For instance, it&lsquo;s hard to write a conclusion before you have written the rest of the proposal .</li>
                    <li>Consider the tips on how to <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/group-writing/#:~:text=Plan%20a%20strategy%20for%20scheduling" target="_blank">Plan a strategy for scheduling</a> from UNC&rsquo;s Writing Center.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Set up a Google Doc or shared Word doc</strong> for your group&rsquo;s proposal. Share the document with everyone in your group, so that you can all edit. Also share the Doc with me (tengrrl@vt.edu). Find additional ways to share your document and related information in <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/group-writing#:~:text=Find%20a%20convenient%20and%20effective%20way%20to%20share%20files" target="_blank">this UNC Writing Center Tip Sheet</a>. </li>

            <li><strong>Decide on the documentation style</strong> that the group will use for the proposal so that group members can add footnotes in the right format. You can use whatever style your group is most comfortable with. Consult the <a href="https://guides.lib.vt.edu/find/citation-style-manuals" target="_blank">Citation and style manuals guide</a> from the library and the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/pages/documentation-and-citations-for-your-projects" target="_blank">Documentation and Citations page</a> for help.</li>

            <li>Make any other preliminary decisions necessary to ensure that all sections flow in a coordinated way. For example, make decisions about how you will refer to your website: will you use its full name or a shortened version?</li>

            <li><strong>Group Leader:</strong> <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-add-an-announcement-in-a-group/ta-p/458" target="_blank">Make an Announcement in your Group</a> that provides the link to your Proposal document, your group&rsquo;s decision on documentation style, and any other decisions you&rsquo;ve made. Placing this information in an Announcement ensures that everyone has access to the link and other important details.</li>

            <li>Add <strong>headings</strong> in the document for each of the required sections of the proposal (listed above). Use the styles in the word processor your group has chosen to format all of the headings consistently, following the relevant documentation:
                <ul class="null">
                    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/116338?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Cchange-the-text-style:~:text=Make%20a%20title%20or%20heading" target="_blank">Make a title or heading in Google Docs</a></li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Format the proposal with <strong>design elements</strong> that will make the subject and the document itself more visually enticing to the reader and hold their attention. These can include:
                <ul class="null">
                    <li>bullet lists</li>
                    <li>headings and subheadings</li>
                    <li>color</li>
                    <li>font type, weight, and size</li>
                    <li>horizontal rules</li>
                    <li>boxes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Add <strong>at least one illustration</strong> (e.g., a photo, a drawing), following these criteria:
                <ul class="null">
                    <li>Use as many visuals as needed to make the subject compelling.</li>
                    <li>Do not add decorative illustrations.</li>
                    <li>Include textual references to visuals.</li>
                    <li>Wrap text around visuals.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Use <strong>footnotes</strong> to cite any sources used in the proposal, using whatever style system your group is most comfortable with. Be consistent, and use the same style throughout. In other words, don&rsquo;t use MLA in the Introduction and then switch to APA in the Justification section.</li>
            <li>Add <strong>page numbers</strong> to your proposal to organize it fully.</li>
            <li><strong>Save your proposal as a PDF</strong> to ensure that its layout and design are preserved when you upload the file to Canvas.</li>
