            <li>Target Due Date: By 11:59 PM on Friday, October 25, 2024.</li>

            <li>Grace Period: Your group will set the end of the grace period for submitting your contributions. All work must be submitted by 11:59 PM on Friday, December 6, 2024.</li>

        <p>You and the members of your group will compose a proposal to write a persuasive recommendation report for improvements to a website, chosen by the group. Each group member will share their Usability Revision and Reflection with the members of your group, and then the group will choose one of the sites to focus on.</p>
        <p>In addition to telling me about the site your groups has chosen, your proposal will provide a schedule for your work on the recommendation report, including plans for group meetings and draft deadlines. It will also identify the responsibilities of all group members.</p>

        <h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
        <p>For our course, I want you to provide your group&rsquo;s topic and plan for the Recommendation Report. Your proposal will give me the chance to help you before you move on to writing your Recommendation Report as well as give your group the opportunity to make preliminary decisions that will be important to your success.</p>
        <p>Beyond this course, research proposals are common features in academia. Before a PhD, MA, or MFA candidate begins work on a dissertation or thesis, for example, they will submit to a committee of readers a well-developed plan for that research document. Additionally, in many technical and scientific courses&mdash;but even in humanities ones&mdash;an upper-division research project is often preceded by such a proposal.

        <ol id="planning" class="skipline">
            <li id="site-backup">Make a backup of the website your group chooses. One group member can make the backup of all the pages and then share the links or files with the rest of the group. Here are some ways to make a backup:
                <ul class="null">
                    <li>Print out the webpage on paper, ensuring all the information on the page prints.</li>

                    <li>Print the webpage and choose to print a PDF, so you&rsquo;ll have a digital backup.</li>

                    <li>Save a backup to the Wayback Machine by <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/" title="Instructions to save a page on the Wayback Machine" target="_blank">following these instructions</a>.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Use the information in the readings and <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/proposal-criteria" target="_blank">Proposal Criteria</a> to divide the work for your group&rsquo;s Proposal, considering the <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/group-writing#:~:text=just%20written%20text%3F-,Drafting/writing,-Separately%20(each%20group" target="_blank">two basic ways to work.</a>
            </li>
            <li>Plan your group schedule&mdash;including draft due dates, meetings, and status updates&mdash;with one another. Here are some tips:
                <ul id="schedule-tips" class="null">
                    <li>Create your schedule to finish by the due date. If your group gets down to the last minute and needs to use the grace period, that&rsquo;s fine; but plan to be on time.</li>
                    <li>Pay attention to the way that sections of the report rely upon one another. For instance, it&lsquo;s hard to write a conclusion before you have the rest of the proposal written.</li>
                    <li>Consider the tips on how to <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/group-writing/#:~:text=Plan%20a%20strategy%20for%20scheduling" target="_blank">Plan a strategy for scheduling</a> from UNC&rsquo;s Writing Center.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Set up a Google Doc or shared Word doc for your group&rsquo;s proposal.
                Share the document with everyone in your group, so that you can all edit. Also share the Doc with me (tengrrl@vt.edu). Find additional ways to share your document and related information in <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/group-writing#:~:text=Find%20a%20convenient%20and%20effective%20way%20to%20share%20files" target="_blank">this UNC Writing Center Tip Sheet</a>.</li>

            <li>Add headings in the document for each of the required sections (listed in the next section) of the proposal. Use the styles in the word processor your group has chosen to format all of the headings consistently, following the relevant documentation:
                <ul class="null">
                    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/116338?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Cchange-the-text-style:~:text=Make%20a%20title%20or%20heading" target="_blank">Make a title or heading in Google Docs</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/add-a-heading-3eb8b917-56dc-4a17-891a-a026b2c790f2" target="_blank">Add a heading in Microsoft Word</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Decide on the documentation style that the group will use for the proposal so that group members can add footnotes in the right format. You can use whatever style your group is most comfortable with. Consult the <a href="https://guides.lib.vt.edu/find/citation-style-manuals" target="_blank">Citation and style manuals guide</a> from the library and the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/documentation-and-citations-for-your-projects" target="_blank">Documentation and Citations page</a> for help.</li>

            <li>Make any other preliminary decisions necessary to ensure that all sections flow in a coordinated way. For example, make decisions about how you will refer to your website: will you use its full name or a shortened version?</li>

                    <li>Uses as many visuals as needed to make the subject compelling.</li>
                    <li>Does not add decorative illustrations.</li>

            </li>

            <li>Use footnotes to cite any sources used in the proposal, using whatever style system your group is most comfortable with. Be consistent, and use the same style throughout. In other words, don&rsquo;t use MLA in the Introduction and then switch to APA in the Justification section.</li>
