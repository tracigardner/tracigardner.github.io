    <div id="postBody" style="background-color: #fefefe;padding: 15px 6px 15px 6px;">
        <p>I have added feedback on all of the Group Proposals submitted by Sunday, April 13. In this post, I&rsquo;ll share details on what to do if your group has an Incomplete on the project. I will also comment on your work generally, and suggest what you can do to improve your project if I asked you to revise. </p>

        <h2>Additional Feedback Information</h2>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li>Because of the way Canvas works, I cannot adjust to individual grades for the assignment yet. I&rsquo;ll change grades for group members who did not participate once I can.</li>
            <li>Every group submitted a proposal by the Checkpoint Deadline, so there are no One-Shot Submissions for this project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>If You Have an Incomplete Because You Did Not Contribute</h2>

        <p>If your group earned a Complete and you did not participate in the work, your Incomplete stands. Since the proposal is finished, there&rsquo;s no way for you to contribute at this point. Be sure that you connect with your group and participate in the work on the remaining Major Projects.</p>

        <h2>If Your Entire Group Has an Incomplete</h2>

        <div class="maroonbox" style="width: 300px;float: right;margin-bottom: 12px;">
            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation fa-2xl" style="color: #861f41;float: right;margin: 27px;font-size: 48px;"></i>Even if you did not contribute to the first submission, you can contribute to the revision and earn a Complete. Reach out to your group immediately.</p>
        </div>

        <p>If everyone in your group has an incomplete for the Group Proposal Assignment, you can still earn a Complete on the project. </p>

        <p>Collaborate with your group to revise the proposal. Everyone in the group should work to improve the project, adding whatever is missing or revising the information to include more (or accurate) details.</p>

        <p>Resubmit your project, and I will review your work again. The last date to submit revisions is Friday, May 2 at 11:59 PM.</p>

        <h2>General Feedback</h2>
        <p>I have included comments on every group&rsquo;s drafts. Use this documentation from Canvas for help finding the notes on your drafts:</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Specific Feedback</h2>
        <p>Use these tips as you revise (or compose) your proposal. These are the errors that I saw most frequently as I read your work. Note that many of these suggestions will apply to your recommendation report as well.</p>
        <ul class="skipline">

            <li><strong>Provide all of the details explained for each of the sections.</strong> Check the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/pages/annotated-proposal-template" target="_blank">Annotated Template</a> for descriptions of what goes in each section.</li>

            <li><strong>Differentiate among the audiences involved.</strong> See the announcement on <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/discussion_topics/2124110" target="_blank">Understanding the Audiences for Your Proposal</a>. </li>

            <li><strong>Include both primary and secondary research.</strong> The proposal should discuss the specific sources that support your argument. See the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/pages/recommendation-report-research-guide" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Research Guide</a> for help.</li>

            <li><strong>Include footnotes to document your sources.</strong> More than half of the groups forgot! See <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/205859/pages/documentation-and-citations-for-your-projects" target="_blank">Documentation and Citations for Your Projects</a> for help.</li>

            <li><strong>Add specific, relevant information in the personnel section.</strong> Explain how each group member&rsquo;s skills or training prepare them to fulfill their role in the project. Use a third person (he, she, they) perspective to discuss members, not first person (I). Here&rsquo;s a great example from a student in this course:
                <blockquote>
                    <p>[Name removed] is a junior majoring in Computer Science. She has experience working in human and computer interaction, GUI, and is currently conducting research on the usability of AI in human evaluation. She will be leading the team&rsquo;s usability testing and audience analysis.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Follow the guidelines for the use of images:</strong>.
                <ul class="null">
                    <li>Use as many visuals (e.g., photos, illustrations, flowcharts, tables) as needed to make the principle compelling and enhance the message in the content.</li>
                    <li>Do not add decorative illustrations.</li>
                    <li>Wrap text around visuals.</li>
                    <li>Include textual references to visuals to <a href="https://pressbooks.library.tamu.edu/howdyorhello/chapter/integrating-visuals/" target="_blank">integrate them into the text</a>. See the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196807/pages/visual-aids-integrating-visuals-into-your-text" target="_blank">Visual Aids: Integrating Visuals into Your Text</a> page for additional help.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>


            <li><strong>Get help from the Writing Center (optional).</strong> Anyone can visit the Writing Center in the library for help with projects for the course. Writing Center tutors can help you strengthen your content as well as work on document design and other issues. You can read more about the Writing Center and make an appointment on the <a href="https://lib.vt.edu/spaces/writing-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Writing Center&rsquo;s webpage</a>.</li>
