    <h1>11 Practical Tips for Productive Teamwork</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Set a Shared Google Doc on Day One:</strong> Create a shared document where all team members can contribute ideas, take notes, and track progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Simple Project Board:</strong> Set up a Trello or Notion board with columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed" to visualize progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate in One Primary Channel:</strong> Avoid confusion by picking one messaging tool (e.g., a Slack channel or a group chat) for team discussions.</li>
        <li><strong>Agree on a Meeting Schedule Upfront:</strong> Set recurring check-ins (e.g., 30 minutes twice a week) to keep everyone accountable.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Meeting Notes Actionable:</strong> After every meeting, document tasks, deadlines, and who's responsible in the shared Google Doc.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Version Control for Documents:</strong> If working on shared files, use Google Docs' "suggesting mode" or Microsoft Word's "track changes" to manage edits.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Expectations for Response Time:</strong> Agree on how quickly team members should respond to messages (e.g., within 24 hours) to keep work moving.</li>
        <li><strong>Address Problems Privately First:</strong> If a team member isn’t contributing, message them directly before escalating the issue to the whole group.</li>
        <li><strong>Give Specific Feedback:</strong> Instead of saying "this section needs work," say "consider adding more evidence in the third paragraph to support our argument."</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate Who Runs the Meetings:</strong> Having a different person lead each session keeps everyone engaged and ensures shared responsibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Confirm Agreements in Writing:</strong> After decisions are made, post a short recap in the shared chat or document so there’s no confusion later.</li>
    </ul>
