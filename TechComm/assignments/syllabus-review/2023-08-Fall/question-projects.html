<p>In this course, you will compose formal and informal documents that build toward your Recommendation Report. The report can be as long as 15&ndash;18 pages long with all the details and information included, but you'll be working on it little by little all term. The sequence of projects outlined below will be your primary focus for the entire term.</p>
<h4>Choose Your Topic</h4>
<p><img style="float: right; margin-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;" src="/courses/132039/files/18866819/preview" alt="image014.png" width="136" height="104" /> &nbsp;Following the details on the&nbsp;<a href="/courses/132039/pages/recommendation-report-topic-requirements">Recommendation Report Topic Requirements</a>, you will choose a topic for your Recommendation Report that</p>
<ul>
<li>relates directly to your major and future career, and</li>
<li>focuses on a specific situation that you can easily observe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you choose a topic, you will fill out a proposal form to tell me what you&rsquo;ve decided. You can include information from your proposal in the introduction and front matter of your Recommendation Report.</p>
<h4>Conduct Secondary Research</h4>
<p><img style="float: right; margin-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;" src="/courses/132039/files/18866820/preview" alt="image015.png" width="140" height="96" /> &nbsp;You will gather secondary research (information other people have collected) to support your project by finding books, journal articles, and/or professional websites. After conducting secondary research, you will create a working bibliography, which will later form the bulk of the References section in your Recommendation Report.</p>
<h4>Conduct Primary Research</h4>
<p><img style="float: right; margin-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;" src="/courses/132039/files/18866821/preview" alt="image016.png" width="81" height="111" /> &nbsp;You will also include primary research (information you collect). You might conduct a survey, observe the situation, or interview people who know about the situation. Ideally, primary research is designed so that someone else can duplicate the research, confirming the findings. As a result, you&rsquo;ll write a how-to document, with a technical description and step-by-step instructions on how to conduct the primary research, which will later become an Appendix in your Recommendation Report.</p>
<h4>Make Your Recommendation</h4>
<p><img style="float: right; margin-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;" src="/courses/132039/files/18866822/preview" alt="image017.png" width="119" height="118" /> &nbsp;Your recommendation report identifies the situation you examined, outlines your research methods and findings, explains the possible options, draws conclusions about each option, and finally makes a recommendation to your audience. We will work through the different portions of the report one-by-one, building the entire report by assembling all your informal and formal work by the end of the term.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #861f41; background-color: #f8d6bd;">We will work on the Recommendation Report all term, little by little, so it is important that you understand how the projects connect. What questions or comments do you have about these technical writing projects?&nbsp;</p>
