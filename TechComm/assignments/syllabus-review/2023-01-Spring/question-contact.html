<p>Please  reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns. <span style="margin-bottom: 12px;"> I check email and Canvas messages several times a day, every day.</span> During the week, I try to answer within 24 hours. Sometimes it takes a little longer. During the weekends and holidays, I usually take a break from email. </p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Name: Call me Traci or Ms. Gardner please.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Pronouns: she, her, hers</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Email: tengrrl@vt.edu</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Office: 214 Shanks Hall (Because of COVID-19, I will not be in the office)</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Office Phone: 540-231-6739 (I’m not in the office, so I won’t be able to answer the phone. Canvas Inbox is the best way to reach me.)</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Questions about Your Progress in the Course or Your Work: For personal questions, send a private message in Canvas, using the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/tkb-p/student#Inbox" target="_blank">Inbox tool</a>. Because Canvas messages are secure, they meet all <a href="https://registrar.vt.edu/FERPA.html" target="_blank">FERPA requirements</a> and protect your privacy. I only answer messages about progress and course work via Canvas for this reason.</li>
</ul>
