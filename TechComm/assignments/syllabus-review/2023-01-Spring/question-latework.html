<h3 style="color: #861f41;">Late Work &amp; Grace Period</h3>
<p>I accept late work. Yes, you read that right. If you cannot meet the suggested due dates for any reason, take the time that you need. You do not need to ask in advance or to explain why your work is late. Just take the time you need and turn your work in when you can.</p>
<p>Most of your work has a grace period until the last day of classes. All course work must be submitted by 11:59 PM on Thursday, July 1, 2021. You can take the time you need, but you must turn in your work by the end of the term.</p>
<h3 style="color: #861f41;">Exceptions</h3>
<p>There are a few exceptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The <strong>work assigned during the first week of the term</strong> focuses on basic information and tasks that are important for success during the term. The grace period for this work ends on Wednesday, June 2. </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">There is no grace period for the <strong>drafts you submit for peer feedback</strong>. These drafts are due by 11:59 PM on Fridays, starting with the second week of class, because of technical requirements for peer feedback. Canvas automatically assigns peer feedback partners at 12:00 AM Saturday. If you do not turn in a draft, Canvas cannot assign peer feedback for you. The good news is that you can turn in whatever you have. You don&rsquo;t have to have a complete draft to get feedback. Just be sure to turn something in by 11:59 PM each Friday.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Work Logs</strong> have a grace period that ends at 11:59 PM on the Wednesday after their Suggested Due Date. These logs must be timely. It makes no sense to go back to fill out a log weeks later. You need to record the work you do as you do it. It’s fine to write, “I didn’t work this week,” in your Work Log if that is accurate. Nothing bad will happen to you (no grades, remember?). </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Your Final Performance Review</strong> must be submitted by 11:59 PM on Friday, July 2, 2021 so that I can submit course grades on time. There are no make-ups or extensions unless approved by the Dean of Students.</li>
</ul>

<p style="padding: 12px;border: 1px solid #861f41;background-color: #F8D6BD;">This is not the typical practice for classes, so I want to make sure you understand. What’s the muddiest point of the Late Policy &amp; Grace Period for you? What questions do you have?</p>
