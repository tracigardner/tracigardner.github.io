<p>This course has no grades. Research tells us that grades are a terrible way to measure learning, so we are doing away with them. You can read more about the problems with grades in &ldquo;<a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/Spring2021/VizGuide2TW-S21.pdf#page=9">So Why Formative Assessment Instead of Grades?</a>&rdquo; in A Short Guide to English 3764: Technical Writing.</p>

Rather than averaging grades for all the work you complete during the term, I base course grades on three things that you tell me about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the time and intensity that you put into your writing.</li>
<li>what you learn by engaging in the course activities and assignments.</li>
<li>how you improve your writing and communication skills over time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>By keeping entries in a work log that record everything you do and reflects on how well you have done.</li>
<li>By setting your goals for the course in a brief statement.</li>
<li>By assessing your work at midterm in a progress report.</li>
<li>By writing a performance review at the end of the term that evaluates your work and proposes the grade you should receive.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about these activities in &ldquo;<a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/Spring2021/VizGuide2TW-S21.pdf#page=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">So Where Do Course Grades Come From?</a>,&rdquo; from A Short Guide to English 3764: Technical Writing.</p>
