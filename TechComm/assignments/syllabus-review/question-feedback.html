<p>Being in  a course without grades doesn’t mean you won’t hear from me. I will  respond to everything you compose. I will focus on formative assessment, the kind of feedback that helps you improve your writing. Here’s the kind of feedback you can expect from me:<img src="images/image030.png" width="81" height="81" alt="Speech bubbles, representing dialogue" style="float: right; margin-left: 12px;"/></p>
<ul>
  <li>Comments that suggest how you can improve your work.</li>
  <li>Advice on how to proceed, such as helping you set priorities for revision.</li>
  <li>Questions.about things that confuse me in your projects.</li>
  <li>Encouragement to try new strategies and take risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get lots of feedback as I ask you to put in your best effort. You just  won’t get  grades.</p>
