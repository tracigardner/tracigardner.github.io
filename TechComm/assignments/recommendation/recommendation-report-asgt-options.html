                <p><strong>A recommendation</strong></p>
                <p>If you are currently having an affair with a sibling of your spouse, embezzling funds from a children’s charity, and emotionally abusing your pet, “Help I have a headache” might provide only a temporary solution to your headache. If you would like a more permanent solution for your headache, may we suggest you end the affair with the sibling of your spouse, stop embezzling funds from children’s charities, and treat your pets kindly.</p>

        <p>As I have worked on my plans for fall, I knew that I wanted to change the topic for the recommendation report. To help with that decision, I gathered the following list of potential topics for the report. It seemed useful to write up what I have so far to share and refer back to as I work on the progression of assignments for the fall course.</p>
        <p>I haven’t decided whether to go with one of these or something else. I’m still brainstorming.</p>

        <div class="skipline">
            <ul>
                <li>Recommend ways that someone in your intended field or career could use AI ethically and legally to address a need or solve a problem.</li>

It positions the student writers as needing to document the research and deliberation process in a report and work to educate employees about the intended purpose and clarify the proper use of each space, establishing policies and expectations where necessary.” (Shelton, Cecilia (2020).
