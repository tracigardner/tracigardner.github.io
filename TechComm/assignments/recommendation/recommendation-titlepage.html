<p>Create the title page for your Recommendation Report, following the examples and details from the textbook.</p>
<h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
<p>Your title page is one of the first things someone will see when they look at your report. It is also an easy piece of your report to write. The hardest part is writing a strong title. </p>
<h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
<li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
<ul class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">The details on a title page, from p. 495:<br>
    “A title page includes at least the title of the report, the name of the writer, and the date of submission. A more complex title page might also include a project number, a list of additional personnel who contributed to the report, and a distribution list.”</li>
  <li class="skipline">Example  title page, on p. 506 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
  <li class="skipline">“Writing Clear, Informative Titles,” on pp. 193–194 (in Chapter 9)</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li class="skipline"><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/effective-report-titles" target="_blank">Effective Report Titles</a> (page in Canvas)</li>
    <li class="skipline">LinkedIn Learning video, “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/technical-writing-reports/the-importance-of-a-clear-title-page?u=57888345" target="_target">The importance of a clear title page</a>” (3m 51s), from the Technical Writing: Reports course.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>When to Do It</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li><strong>Suggested Due Date:</strong> By 11:59 PM on Friday, June 18, 2021.</li>
  <li><strong>Timely Feedback Date: </strong> If you need more time, take more time. Turn your title page in by 11:59 PM on Wednesday, June 23, 2021 if you want me to provide feedback.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Chance Date:</strong> The  grace period for your work ends at 11:59 PM on Thursday, July 1.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How You Do It</h2>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Open the word processor document where you are working on your recommendation report. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Scroll through the outline you created to the location for your title page.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Follow the example on p. 506 of Markel and Selber to add the text for your title page. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Format your title page similar to the example on p. 506 as well.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Review the title you have written to make sure it follows the guidelines on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/effective-report-titles" target="_blank">Effective Report Titles</a> page and from the textbook (See above).</li>
  <li class="skipline">Review the “Prepared for” information. Your report should be prepared for the specific person who can take action on your recommendation (e.g., some administrator on campus for a problem you are exploring on campus, some manager at a workplace, town council or a similar group in your local community). It is NOT prepared for me. I cannot make your recommendation happen.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Copy the information from your title page and paste it into text box below. You do not have to worry about the formatting here, only in the finished report.</li>
</ol>
