<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Based on your knowledge of the topic and your research, write the Recommendations section of your Recommendation Report.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>The Recommendations section is where you tell your readers what they should do. This section is one of the required parts of your recommendation report. I am breaking the report out, section-by-section, to guide you through the process of writing the document and help make sure you include everything that is required for a complete report.</p>
<h3>Where You Can Find Help</h3>
<ul>
  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">The details on the Recommendations section, from p. 480:<br>
        “Recommendations answer the question ‘What should we do?’ . . . [R]ecommendations do not always flow directly from conclusions. Always consider recommending that the organization take no action or no action at this time.”</li>
      <li class="skipline">Guidelines: Writing Recommendations, on p. 480.</li>
      <li class="skipline">Example Recommendations section, on p. 511 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">LinkedIn Learning video, “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/technical-writing-reports/conclusions-and-recommendations?u=57888345" target="_blank">Conclusions and recommendations</a>” (4m 9s), from the Technical Writing: Reports course. </li>
</ul>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Complete a draft of your Methods, Results, and Conclusions sections before beginning your Recommendations section.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Open the word processor document where you are working on your recommendation report. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Scroll through the outline you created to the location for your Recommendations section.</li>
        <div class="maroonbox" style="width: 330px;float: right;margin-left: 12px;padding: 6px;">
        <h4><strong>Tips for Writing Sub-Headings</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the  headings in the Recommendations section of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8 of the textbook as a model.</li>
        <li>Consult the advice in the “Writing Clear, Informative Headings,” section on pp. 194–197 (in Chapter 9 of the textbook).</li>
        <li>Use the help on these pages: <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/information-rich-signposts-help-readers" target="_target">Information-Rich Signposts Help Readers</a> and <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/use-strong-phrasing-in-your-headings" target="_blank">Use Strong Phrasing in Your Headings</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <li class="skipline">Make any changes necessary to the headings for the sub-sections of your Conclusions section:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Choose one of these two options, depending upon your situation:
        <ul>
          <li>If you added sub-sections when you created your outline, check your headings to ensure that you have included all the recommendations that you want to make. </li>
          <li>If you did not include sub-sections in your outline, add them now, covering all the recommendations that you want to make.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li>Add any recommendations what came to you as you worked on the other sections of the body. </li>
      <li>Review the sub-headings to ensure you focus on what the reader should do. Keep the recommendations manageable. Two or three are probably plenty. In some cases, one may be enough.</li>
      <li>Check that the phrasing of the sub-headings in the Recommendations sections repeats keywords and phrases so that a reader can easily tell what parts of the body of the report support your recommendations.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  <li class="skipline">Write the content for the Recommendations section:
    <ol type="a">
      <li><strong>Explain</strong> the implications of your research under each of the sub-headings.</li>
      <li>Refer to the research  results to support your implications.</li>
      <li>Work back through the information you have added to make sure you have sentences and clear ideas.</li>
      <li>Focus on your conclusions only. Save your recommendations for the Recommendations section. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Review the section and make any additions or changes, using the information from the textbook and LinkedIn Learning video as needed. At this point, focus in particular in making sure that you have included everything that answers the question, &ldquo;What did it [your methods and results] mean?&rdquo; </li>
  <li class="skipline">Copy the information from your Conclusions section in your word processor document, and paste it into text box below. You do not have to worry about the formatting here, only in the finished report. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Submit your work:
    <ul>
      <li>Submit  here by 11:59 PM on Friday, April 16.</li>
      <li>If you need more time, submit your document later. The assignment will close on Friday, April 30. Realize  that I may not have time to provide extensive feedback on work submitted after Wednesday, April 21. </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Make a backup of your word processor document. </li>
</ol>

<p><span>GUIDELINES: Writing Recommendations </span></p>
<p><span>As you draft your recommendations, consider the following four factors: </span></p>
<p><span>Content. Be clear and specific. If the project has been unsuccessful, don&rsquo;t simply recommend that your readers &ldquo;try some other alternatives.&rdquo; What alternatives do you recommend and why? </span></p>
<p><span>Tone. When you recommend a new course of action, be careful not to offend whoever formulated the earlier course. Do not write that following your recommendations will &ldquo;correct the mistakes&rdquo; that have been made. Instead, your recommendations should &ldquo;offer great promise for success.&rdquo; A restrained, understated tone is more persuasive because it shows that you are interested only in the good of your organization, not personal rivalries. </span></p>
<p><span>Form. If the report leads to only one recommendation, use traditional paragraphs. If the report leads to more than one recommendation, consider a numbered list. </span></p>
<p><span>Location. Consider including a summary of the recommendations &mdash; or, if they are brief, the full list &mdash; after the executive summary or in the introduction as well as at the end of the body of the report.</span></p>
