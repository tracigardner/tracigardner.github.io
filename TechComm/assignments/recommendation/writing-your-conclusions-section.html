    </figure>
<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Based on your knowledge of the topic and your research, write the Conclusions section of your Recommendation Report.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>The Results section is where you tell your readers about what you found when you conducted research. This section is one of the required parts of your recommendation report. I am breaking the report out, section-by-section, to guide you through the process of writing the document and help make sure you include everything that is required for a complete report.</p>
<h3>Where You Can Find Help</h3>
<ul>
  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">The details on the Conclusions section, from p. 480:<br>
        “Conclusions answer the question ‘What does it mean?’ They are the implications of the results. To draw conclusions, you need to think carefully about your results, weighing whether they point clearly to a single meaning.”</li>
      <li class="skipline">Example Conclusions section, on pp. 509–510 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
      <li class="skipline">“Evaluating the Information,” on pp.  126&ndash;30 (in Chapter 6 of the textbook).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">LinkedIn Learning video, “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/technical-writing-reports/conclusions-and-recommendations?u=57888345" target="_blank">Conclusions and recommendations</a>” (4m 9s), from the Technical Writing: Reports course. </li>
</ul>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Complete a draft of your Methods and Results sections before beginning this section.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Open the word processor document where you are working on your recommendation report. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Scroll through the outline you created to the location for your Conclusions section.</li>

        <h4><strong>Tips for Writing Sub-Headings</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the  headings in the Conclusions section of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8 of the textbook as a model.</li>
        <li>Consult the advice in the “Writing Clear, Informative Headings,” section on pp. 194–197 (in Chapter 9 of the textbook).</li>
        <li>Use the help on these pages: <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/information-rich-signposts-help-readers" target="_target">Information-Rich Signposts Help Readers</a> and <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/use-strong-phrasing-in-your-headings" target="_blank">Use Strong Phrasing in Your Headings</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <li class="skipline">Make any changes necessary to the headings for the sub-sections of your Conclusions section:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Begin with the sub-headings from your Methods and Results sections. Your conclusions are drawn from the research you conducted so the sub-headings in the Conclusions section should have a one-to-one correspondence to the sub-headings from the Methods and Results sections.</li>
      <li>Add a sub-heading in the Conclusions section for each of the sub-headings in the Methods and Results sections. Check the table of contents in 
      the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8 of the textbook to see the relationship among these three sections.</li>
      <li>Check that the phrasing of the sub-headings in the Conclusions sections repeats keywords and phrases so that a reader can easily tell what parts of the research support the Conclusions you draw.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  <li class="skipline">Write the content for the Conclusions section:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Explain the implications of your research under each of the sub-headings.</li>
      <li>Refer to the research  results to support your implications.</li>
      <li>Work back through the information you have added to make sure you have sentences and clear ideas.</li>
      <li>Focus on your conclusions only. Save your recommendations for the Recommendations section. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Review the section and make any additions or changes, using the information from the textbook and LinkedIn Learning video as needed. At this point, focus in particular in making sure that you have included everything that answers the question, &ldquo;What did it [your methods and results] mean?&rdquo; </li>
  <li class="skipline">Copy the information from your Conclusions section in your word processor document, and paste it into text box below. You do not have to worry about the formatting here, only in the finished report. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Submit your work:
    <ul>
      <li>Submit  here by 11:59 PM on Friday, April 16.</li>
      <li>If you need more time, submit your document later. The assignment will close on Friday, April 30. Realize  that I may not have time to provide extensive feedback on work submitted after Wednesday, April 21. </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Make a backup of your word processor document. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>Be sure to track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/126055/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
  <li>Traci will add the related points to Canvas when she marks your work Complete.<br>
    <em>Why this change?</em> To allow everyone a longer grace period. This system will still give you the points you earn, but it gives you longer to earn them.  </li>
