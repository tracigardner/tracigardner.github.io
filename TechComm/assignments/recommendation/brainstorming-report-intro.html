<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Begin gathering material for the introduction to your report by answering the questions included in the Markel and Selber&rsquo;s <em>Technical Communication</em> on page 479. </p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>You are working on a long report that includes many sections. Working on the different sections is a good way to avoid being overwhelmed. I am asking you to begin with brainstorming facts for the introduction because it includes a lot of the basic information that you will expand upon later in the report. </p>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Download the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/files/18139139/download?download_frd=1" target="_blank">Introduction document</a> (a word processor file). <br>
    Note: you must download the file. Everyone in the class uses the same file, so you cannot edit the file at the link.
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Open the file in a word processor and add your answers, following the instructions in the document.
    <ul>
      <li>Add more lines to the answer spaces as you need. You can write as much as you want to.</li>
      <li>Write informally. You are gathering notes, not writing the final version for your report.</li>
      <li>Skip a question if you are unsure of the answer or have not conducted enough research to know. Add a note to skipped questions that explains why you skipped it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Save the finished document once you add all your notes.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Submit your document:
    <ul>
      <li>Submit your project here by 11:59 PM on Friday, April 9.</li>
      <li>If you need more time, submit your document later. The assignment will close on Friday, April 30.<br>
        <em></em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">After you have submitted your outline, use the information in your document to write the introduction of your report.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
<p>You track and grade your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>Track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
  <li>Traci will not provide any comments since these are your working notes. She will just look at the file to see that you answered most of the questions.</li>
  <li>Traci will add the related points to Canvas when she marks your work Complete.<em><br>
    Why this change?</em> To allow everyone a longer grace period. This system will still give you the points you earn, but it gives you longer to earn them.</li>
