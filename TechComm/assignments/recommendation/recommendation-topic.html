<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>This week we begin the recommendation report, which all of the activities in this course relate to. Your job is simply to get started by choosing the topic that you will focus on for the term. After you make your choice, you’ll tell me about it by answering a few questions. You will also share your topic with your small group (the groups named for birds).</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>You need to choose and tell me what your project for the course will be since it relates to every other major project in the class. Review the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/Spring2021/VizGuide2TW-S21.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Sequence of Technical Writing Projects from the Short Guide</a> to remind yourself how the projects connect. This week, we’re at the first step of the sequence, “Choose Your Topic.”</p>
<p>I want you to tell me about your project now so that you have a chance to make sure your topic meets the requirements for the larger projects. It’s not fun for anyone if you get to the end of the class before you find out your topic is completely off. So I want you to tell me about your topic, but you want me to know about it too. If you start out with a good topic, everything else will be smoother.</p>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Read the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/recommendation-report-overview" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Overview</a>, which explains the recommendation report assignment and the requirements that will influence your choice.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Choose a topic for your recommendation report, keeping the information from the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/recommendation-report-overview" target="_blank">Overview</a> in mind.
  <li class="skipline">Jot out a short explanation of your topic:  </li>
  <ul class="skipline">
    <li class="skipline"> Aim for about the length of a Tweet, which is 280 characters. There’s  no problem if you run over.</li>
    <li class="skipline">Make your topic specific. For example, don’t say “an intersection.” Tell us exactly what intersection in what town.</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="skipline">Share your short explanation in this week&rsquo;s  Discussion in Canvas, following the instructions for the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/discussion_topics/1003407" target="_blank">Topic Feedback  Discussion</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Aim to post your explanation by Wednesday so that others in your group have time to provide feedback.</li>
    </ul>
  </li> 
  <li class="skipline">Take the feedback from your group into account, and revise your topic, if necessary.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Answer the questions below to tell me about your topic. This week includes a Spring Break Day, so I have included short targets for your responses. I am not expecting long paragraphs (though if you want to write more, you always can).</li>
  <ul class="skipline">
    <li>Submit your rough draft here by 11:59 PM on Thursday, February 4.</li>
    <li>If you need more time, submit your rough draft by the end of the grace period, at 11:59 PM on Monday, February 8. </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
<p>You track and grade your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/126055/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
<li>Post your rough draft in Discussions in Canvas with a specific question, for this week&rsquo;s <span class="skipline"><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/discussion_topics/1003407" target="_blank">Topic Feedback  Discussion</a></span>.</li>
<li>Wait for me to give you points for your answers. Canvas cannot automatically grade written text, so I have to add your points manually. 
  <ul>
    <li>As soon as I confirm that your topic meets the requirements, I will give you full points. </li>
    <li>If something is missing or needs more details, you will have a chance to revise. You will still earn full points, as long as you revise.</li>
  </ul>
