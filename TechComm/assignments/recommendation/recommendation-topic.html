<h2>What  You Will Practice</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How to analyze your audience and purpose so that you can choose how to present information clearly and effectively. <strong>[<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 1]</strong></li>
  <li>How to find and evaluate original, ethical research evidence that supports your position. <strong>[<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 2 &amp; 3]</strong></li>
  <li>How to write documents you may encounter in the workplace (specifically correspondence).  <strong>[<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 4]</strong><img src="../../-images/noun_Sign_2033154.png" width="195" height="327" alt="Computer screen showing an email message" style="float:right;margin: 0px 0px 12px 12px;" /></li>
</ul>
<h2>What I Want You to Do</h2>
<p>Get started on the recommendation report by choosing the topic that you will focus on for the term. Use the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/recommendation-topic-examples" target="_blank">Recommendation Topic Examples</a> to help with your choice. After you make your choice,  tell me about it by answering a few questions.  </p>
<h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
<p>You need to choose the topic for your recommendation report since your topic relates to every other  project in the class. Review the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/semester/2021-05-SummerI/VizGuide2TW-Su21.pdf#page=5" target="_blank">Sequence of Technical Writing Projects from the Short Guide</a> to remind yourself how the projects connect. This activity is the first step of the sequence, “Choose Your Topic.”</p>
<p>We’re choosing topics now so that I can review your ideas and approve the topic. I want to make sure your topic will work right away, while it’s still easy to change or clarify your topic.  If you start out with a good topic, everything else will be smoother.</p>

<h2>When to Do It</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How You Do It</h2>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Read the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/recommendation-report-overview" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Overview</a>, which explains the recommendation report assignment and the requirements that will influence your choice.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Choose a topic for your recommendation report, keeping the information from the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/recommendation-report-overview" target="_blank">Overview</a> in mind.
  <li class="skipline">Jot out a short explanation of your topic:  </li>
  <ul class="skipline">
    <li class="skipline"> Aim for about the length of a Tweet, which is 280 characters. There’s  no problem if you run over.</li>
    <li class="skipline">Make your topic specific. For example, don’t say “an intersection.” Tell us exactly what intersection in what town.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li class="skipline">Share your short explanation in this week&rsquo;s  Discussion in Canvas, following the instructions for the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/discussion_topics/1003407" target="_blank">Topic Feedback  Discussion</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Aim to post your explanation by Wednesday so that others in your group have time to provide feedback.</li>
    </ul>
  </li> 
  <li class="skipline">Take the feedback from your group into account, and revise your topic, if necessary.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Answer the questions below to tell me about your topic. This week includes a Spring Break Day, so I have included short targets for your responses. I am not expecting long paragraphs (though if you want to write more, you always can).</li>
  <ul class="skipline">
    <li>Submit your rough draft here by 11:59 PM on Thursday, February 4.</li>
    <li>If you need more time, submit your rough draft by the end of the grace period, at 11:59 PM on Monday, February 8. </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<h2>How to Assess &amp; Track Your Work</h2>
<p>You track and grade your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
<li>Post your rough draft in Discussions in Canvas with a specific question, for this week&rsquo;s <span class="skipline"><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/discussion_topics/1003407" target="_blank">Topic Feedback  Discussion</a></span>.</li>
<li>Wait for me to give you points for your answers. Canvas cannot automatically grade written text, so I have to add your points manually. 
  <ul>
    <li>As soon as I confirm that your topic meets the requirements, I will give you full points. </li>
    <li>If something is missing or needs more details, you will have a chance to revise. You will still earn full points, as long as you revise.</li>
  </ul>
