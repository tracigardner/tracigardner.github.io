<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Revise your Recommendation Report, using the feedback from your peer reviewers and any notes that I added to your submissions. Finish your Recommendation Report, and assess your own draft by completing this checklist. Once you confirm that you have met the basic requirements, upload your finished  project in Part 2 of Week Fifteen Module.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>In the workplace, you should be able to compare your work against a list of specifications to determine if your project is complete. This checklist works in just that way: You must be able to confirm every one of the project criteria in the checklist before you can turn in your work. </p>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Review  the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/recommendation-report-criteria" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Criteria</a>, which outlines the requirements for the project.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Review the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/crap-design-principles" target="_blank">CRAP Design Principles</a>, which accounts for one of the criterion on the checklist.</li>
    <div style="float: right;width: 240px;margin-left: 18px;padding-left: 6px;" class="maroonbox">
        <p><img src="../../-images/noun_Tips_2021795.png" width="64" height="64" alt="" style="float: left; margin-bottom: 42px;"/>Be sure that you answer the questions accurately. If you do not meet all the criteria, your report will be returned for revision.</p>
    </div>
  <li class="skipline">Complete the checklist below, indicating the criteria for the Recommendation Report that you have met. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Submit your checklist responses and check your points total for the activity:  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you earned full points (24 points) for your checklist responses, move on to Part 2 of the Week Fifteen module and upload your project.</li>
    <li>If you earned fewer than 24 points, revise your Recommendation Report to meet all the criteria  (focusing on anything you marked “False”). You must be able to confirm all the criteria before you can submit your project. </li>
  </ul></ol>
<h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li>You will automatically receive the points for your work when you submit this checklist. Canvas checks the work and awards the points. You can complete the checklist as many times as necessary to earn full points.</li>
  <li>Once you earn full points, you MUST also submit your project in Part 2 of the Week Fifteen module. </li>
  <li>Once you submit your report, Traci will review your work:
    <ul>
      <li>If she finds that your work is complete and meets all the criteria, your points are confirmed and you are done with this project.</li>
      <li>If she finds that it does not meet  the requirements for the assignment, she will adjust the points on your checklist and ask you to resubmit once you have revised to meet the project criteria.</li>
      <li>If she finds that you did not submit your project, she will adjust the points and ask you to submit it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
