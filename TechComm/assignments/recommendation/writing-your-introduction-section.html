    </figure>
<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Return to the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/assignments/1165533" target="_blank">Brainstorming Your Intro activity</a> and find all the information you gathered about your project. Using that information and other notes you have, write the Introduction section of your Recommendation Report.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>The Introduction section provides an overview of the report that follows. It provides context, background, and forecasts the conclusions and recommendations. This section is one of the required parts of your recommendation report. I am breaking the report out, section-by-section, to guide you through the process of writing the document and help make sure you include everything that is required for a complete report.</p>
<h3>Where You Can Find Help</h3>
<ul>
  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">The details on the Introduction Section, from p. 479:<br>
        “The introduction helps readers understand the technical discussion that follows.”</li>
      <li class="skipline">The list of  nine questions to answer in your Introduction, on p. 479.</li>
      <li class="skipline">Example  Introduction Section, on pp. 496–497 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">LinkedIn Learning video, “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/technical-writing-reports/how-to-write-an-introduction?u=57888345" target="_blank">How to write an introduction</a>” (4m 8s), from the Technical Writing: Reports course.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Return to your responses to the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/assignments/1165533" target="_blank">Brainstorming Your Intro activity</a> (You can find it  on the Grades page) and skim through your responses.</li>
  <li class="skipline">If you skipped any questions, answer them now. You should have a response for every one of the nine questions. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Open the word processor document where you are working on your recommendation report. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Scroll through the outline you created to the location for your Introduction section.</li>
        
  <li class="skipline">Write the content for the Methods Section:
    
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Copy the information from  the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/assignments/1165533" target="_blank">Brainstorming Your Intro activity</a>, and paste it into your recommendation report document.</li>
     <div class="maroonbox" style="width: 390px;float: right;margin-left: 12px;padding: 6px;">
        <h4><strong>Writing Clear, Informative Paragraphs</strong></h4>
        <p>Because you are working from the Q&amp;A notes from the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/assignments/1165533" target="_blank">Brainstorming Your Intro activity</a>, you need to ensure that your introduction flows smoothly. The information needs to sound like paragraphs, rather than a series of answers to questions.</p>
        <p>Use these sections from the textbook to as you compose and revise your introduction:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the advice in the “Structure Paragraphs Clearly” section, from Chapter 9 of the textbook (pp. 202–207).</li>
        <li>See the strategies in the “Use Coherence Devices within and between Paragraphs” section, from Chapter 9 of the textbook (pp. 207–210)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
        <li>Use the details in Chapter 7, “Organizing Your Information,” to determine how you want to structure your information. It is possible to use more than one pattern. For instance, you might begin with a general-to-specific pattern or a chronological pattern to provide basic information and background, and then you might shift to a problem-methods-solution pattern to provide an overview the report.</li>
        
      <li>Rearrange your notes from the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/assignments/1165533" target="_blank">Brainstorming Your Intro activity</a> to fit the pattern(s) you have chosen. </li>
      <li>Work back through the information you have added to expand the notes into full paragraphs.</li>
      <li>Revise your introduction to make sure you have transitions, sentences and clear ideas.</li>
      <li>Add <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/documentation-and-citations-for-your-projects" target="_blank">Documentation and Citations</a> anywhere that you include paraphrased information or quotations from outside sources. </li>
      <li>Ensure that any information you quote from your primary or secondary research is enclosed in quotation marks. Examples might be something that someone says in a response to a survey or interview (both primary research) or something stated in an journal article or book (both secondary research).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Review the section and make any additions or changes, using the information from the textbook and LinkedIn Learning video as needed. At this point, focus in particular in making sure that you have included everything that answers the question, &ldquo;What is this document about?&rdquo; </li>
  <li class="skipline">Copy the information from your Introduction section in your word processor document, and paste it into text box below. You do not have to worry about the formatting here, only in the finished report.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Submit your work:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Submit  here by 11:59 PM on Friday, April 16.</li>
      <li>If you need more time, submit your document later. The assignment will close on Friday, April 30. Realize  that I may not have time to provide extensive feedback on work submitted after Wednesday, April 21. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Make a backup of your word processor document.</li>
</ol>
