<h2>The Task</h2>
<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Return to the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/assignments/1165533" target="_blank">Brainstorming Your Intro activity</a> and find all the information you gathered about your project. Using the recorded information and other notes you have, write the Introduction section of your Recommendation Report.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>The Introduction section provides an overview of the report that follows. It provides context, background, and forecasts the conclusions and recommendations. This section is one of the required parts of your recommendation report. I am breaking the report out, section-by-section, to guide you through the process of writing the document and help make sure you include everything that is required for a complete report.</p>
<h3>Where You Can Find Help</h3>
<ul>
  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">The details on the Introduction Section, from p. 479:<br>
        “The introduction helps readers understand the technical discussion that follows.”</li>
      <li class="skipline">The list of  nine questions to answer in your Introduction, on p. 479.</li>
      <li class="skipline">Example  Introduction Section, on pp. 496–497 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">LinkedIn Learning video, “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/technical-writing-reports/how-to-write-an-introduction?u=57888345" target="_blank">How to write an introduction</a>” (4m 8s), from the Technical Writing: Reports course.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Return to your responses to the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/assignments/1165533" target="_blank">Brainstorming Your Intro activity</a> (You can find it  on the Grades page) and skim through your responses.</li>
  <li class="skipline">If you skipped any questions, answer them now. You should have a response for every one of the nine questions. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Open the word processor document where you are working on your recommendation report. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Scroll through the outline you created to the location for your Introduction section.</li>
        
  <li class="skipline"><strong>Write the content for the Methods Section:
    </strong>
    <ol type="a">
      <li><strong>Sort the information from your Work Log into the different sub-sections of your Methods section. </strong></li>
      <li><strong>Expand on the information with other notes and information that you have.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Include a reference to the Instructions that you created and followed to collect your primary research. [Note: The Instructions document itself will go in an appendix, not in the Methods section. Just describe what you did here.]</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Work back through the information you have added to make sure you have sentences and clear ideas.</strong></li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline"><strong>Review the section and make any additions or changes, using the information from the textbook and LinkedIn Learning video as needed. At this point, focus in particular in making sure that you have included everything that answers the question, &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; </strong></li>
  <li class="skipline"><strong>Copy the information from your Methods Section in your word processor document, and paste it into text box below. You do not have to worry about the formatting here, only in the finished report.</strong></li>
  <li class="skipline"><strong>Submit your work:
    </strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Submit  here by 11:59 PM on Friday, April 16.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>If you need more time, submit your document later. The assignment will close on Friday, April 30. Realize  that I may not have time to provide extensive feedback on work submitted after Wednesday, April 21. </strong></li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Make a backup of your word processor document, because backups never hurt! </li>
</ol>
<h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>Be sure to track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/126055/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
  <li>Traci will add the related points to Canvas when she marks your work Complete. She will check only for completion at this stage.<br>
    <em>Why this change?</em> To allow everyone a longer grace period. This system will still give you the points you earn, but it gives you longer to earn them.  </li>
