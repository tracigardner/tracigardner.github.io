Letter of Transmittal: Introduce the primary readers to the purpose and content. 2. Title Page: List the title, author, and date as well as the recipient. 3. Abstract: Provide a brief technical summary for readers familiar with the topic. 4. Table of Contents: List headings and sub-headings with page numbers or links. 5.

      <figcaption style="color: #861f41;font-size: 1em;">The Sections of the Front Matter of the Recommendation Report</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Summarize your Recommendation Report, in approximately 200 words or less, for readers who are familiar with the technical subject, so that they have all the basic information needed to determine whether to read the full report.</p>
    <h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
    <p>The front matter for your report may feel repetitive, but the items in the front matter have different audiences. I’m asking you to work on each of the sections separately so that you pay attention to the needs of each audience and help make sure you include everything that is required for a complete report.</p>
    <h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>
    <div class="maroonbox" style="width: 330px;float: right;margin-left: 12px;padding: 6px;">
      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Focus on Audience</h4>
      <p>Write the abstract for readers who understand the underlying technical aspects of your report. Provide the details that the people who will be involved in the actual work involved will understand (e.g., engineers, scientists). You are giving technically-savvy readers the information to confirm your approach and understand your plan from a working point of view.</p>

          <li class="skipline">The details on the Abstract, from p. 495–496:<br>
            “An abstract is a brief technical summary of the report, usually no more than 200 words. It addresses readers who are familiar with the technical subject and who need to decide whether they want to read the full report. In an abstract, you can use technical terminology and refer to advanced concepts in the field. . . .
            Abstracts often contain a list of half a dozen or so keywords, which are entered into electronic databases.”</li>

      <li><strong>Suggested Due Date: </strong>By 11:59 PM on Friday, April 22, 2022, to participate in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/discussion_topics/1233622" target="_blank">Last-Chance Recommendation Report Feedback Discussion</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Grace Period:</strong> The grace period for this activity ends at 11:59 PM on Friday, April 29, 2022.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How You Do It</h2>
    <ol class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">Complete a draft of the body sections of your report (<a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/writing-your-introduction" target="_blank">Introduction</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/writing-your-methods-section" target="_blank">Methods</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/writing-your-results-section" target="_blank">Results</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/writing-your-conclusions-section" target="_blank">Conclusions</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/writing-your-recommendations-section" target="_blank">Recommendations</a>) before beginning your Abstract. It’s easier to summarize the report if you have already written it.</li>
      <li class="skipline">Open the word processor document where you are working on your recommendation report. </li>
      <li class="skipline">Scroll through the document to the location for your Abstract (after the Title Page, and before the Table of Contents).</li>
      <li class="skipline">Add the headings for your Abstract:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Add the word <em>Abstract </em>at the top of the page and center the line.</li>
          <li>Skip a blank line.</li>
          <li>Add the title of your Recommendation Report, using more than one line if necessary.</li>
          <li> Center the title on the page.</li>
          <li>Skip a blank line.</li>
          <li>Set the text to left alignment.</li>
          <li>Add details on the author (you) with the heading “Prepared by:”</li>
          <li>Skip another blank line.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="skipline">Write the content of your Abstract, all in one paragraph, focusing on the audience of people with technical knowledge of the topic:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Begin by explaining the background and purpose of the report.</li>
          <li>Summarize the research methods you used.</li>
          <li>Explain the main findings, providing relevant technical information.</li>
          <li>Close with your major recommendations, again providing relevant technical information.</li>
          <li>Skip a blank line.</li>
          <li>Add the label “Keywords:”</li>
          <li>List the keywords for your report, separating them with commas. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="skipline">Review your Abstract and make any additions or changes, using the information from the textbook and LinkedIn Learning video as needed. Because the Abstract is for technical readers, be sure that you include appropriate technical information and terminology. </li>
      <li class="skipline">Move on to the next part of your report that you want to work on.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to Assess &amp; Track Your Work</h2>
    <p>You track and grade your own work in this course. Be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li>Track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a working draft for your Best Submission. It is marked Complete in Canvas when you submit it for one of the two Feedback Discussions.</p>
