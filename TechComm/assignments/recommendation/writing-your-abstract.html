        <figcaption style="color: #861f41;font-size: 1em;">The Sections of the Front Matter of the Recommendation Report</figcaption>
    </figure>
<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Summarize your Recommendation Report, in approximately 200 words or less, for readers who are familiar with the technical subject, so that they have all the basic information needed to determine whether to read the full report.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>The front matter for your report may feel repetitive, but the different items in the front matter have different audiences.  I’m asking you to work on each of the sections separately so that you pay attention to the needs of each audience and help make sure you include everything that is required for a complete report.</p>
<h3>Where You Can Find Help</h3>
<ul>
  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">The details on the Abstract, from p. 481–482:<br>
        “An abstract is a brief technical summary of the report, usually no more than 200 words. It addresses readers who are familiar with the technical subject and who need to decide whether they want to read the full report. In an abstract, you can use technical terminology and refer to advanced concepts in the field. . . . 
        Abstracts often contain a list of half a dozen or so keywords, which are entered into electronic databases.”</li>
      <li class="skipline">Example Abstract, on pp. 493 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">LinkedIn Learning video, “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/technical-writing-reports/plan-and-write-the-abstract?u=57888345" target="_blank">Plan and write the abstract</a>” (4m 13s), from the Technical Writing: Reports course. </li>
</ul>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Complete a draft of the body sections of your report (Introduction, Methods, Results, Findings, Recommendations) before beginning your Abstract. It’s easier to summarize the report if you have already written it.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Open the word processor document where you are working on your recommendation report. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Scroll through the document to the location for your Abstract (after the Title Page, and before the Table of Contents).</li>
  <li class="skipline">Add the headings for your Abstract:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Add the word <em>Abstract </em>at the top of the page and center the line.</li>
      <li>Skip a blank line.</li>
      <li>Add the title of your Recommendation Report, using more than one line if necessary.</li>
      <li> Center the title on the page.</li>
      <li>Skip a blank line.</li>
      <li>Set the text to left alignment.</li>
      <li>Add details on the author (you) with the heading “Prepared by:”</li>
      <li>Skip another blank line.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Write the content of your Abstract, all in one paragraph:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Begin by explaining the background and purpose of  the report.</li>
      <li>Summarize the research methods you used.</li>
      <li>Explain the main findings, providing relevant technical information.</li>
      <li>Close with your major recommendations, again providing relevant technical information.</li>
      <li>Skip a blank line.</li>
      <li>Add the label “Keywords:”</li>
      <li>List the keywords for your report, separating them with commas.  </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Review your Abstract and make any additions or changes, using the information from the textbook and LinkedIn Learning video as needed. Because the Abstract is for technical readers, be sure that you include appropriate technical information and terminology.  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Copy the text from your Abstract in your word processor document, and paste it into text box below. You do not have to worry about the formatting here, only in the finished report. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Submit your work:
    <ul>
      <li>Submit  here by 11:59 PM on Friday, April 23.</li>
      <li>If you need more time, submit your document later. The assignment will close on Friday, April 30. </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Make a backup of your word processor document. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>Be sure to track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
  <li>Traci will add the related points to Canvas when she marks your work Complete. She will check only for completion at this stage.<br>
    <em>Why this change?</em> To allow everyone a longer grace period. This system will still give you the points you earn, but it gives you longer to earn them.  </li>
