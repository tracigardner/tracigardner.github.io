<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use conventions of various workplace genres, such as proposals, instructions, correspondence, reports, and slide decks, with understanding of how the genre conventions can be used as heuristics and as principles of arrangement. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 4]</li>
  <li>Apply principles of effective visual design for print and electronic presentation, including hierarchical, chronological, and spatial arrangements. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 6]</li>
  <li>Identify and apply the principles of effective style in the composing of usable, reader-centered written communications. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 7]</li>

    </figure>
<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>List all of the sources for your report, using the style preferred by your field. This section is sometimes called your bibliography or works cited page. </p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>The References is where you credit out the sources that contributed to your report. You need References to ensure that readers know which information is yours and which was gathered from outside sources. Without References, it will appear that you plagiarized the report. This section is one of the required parts of your recommendation report. I am breaking the report out, section-by-section, to guide you through the process of writing the document and help make sure you include everything that is required for a complete report.</p>
<h3>Where You Can Find Help</h3>
<ul>
  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">The details on References, from p. 488:<br>
        “Many reports contain a list of references (sometimes called a <em>bibliography</em> or <em>list of works cited</em>) as part of the back matter. References and the accompanying textual citations throughout the report are called <em>documentation.</em> Documentation acknowledges your debt to your sources, establishes your credibility as a writer, and helps readers locate and review your sources.” </li>
      <li class="skipline">Example References section, on pp. 512 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
