<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Review the information required in your Recommendation Report, and write an outline for your draft.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p> By creating an outline, you are sketching out the work that you need to do. Longer documents frequently require specific sections and information, and your outline can help ensure you include them all. Think of your outline as a working plan for all the things you will write for your report. </p>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Review the information  you should include in your report on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/recommendation-report-criteria" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Criteria</a> page.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Review Table 18.1: Elements of a Typical Report, on page 478 of&nbsp;<em>Technical Communication</em>&nbsp;for  details on report structure.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Examine the&nbsp;structure of the Sample Report, Figure 18.8 on pages 490&ndash;513 of Markel and Selber&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Technical Communication</em>.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Create a rough outline  for your Recommendation Report, relying on the information from the  <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/recommendation-report-criteria" target="_blank">Criteria</a> and the textbook.
<ul>
      <li>Begin your outline with your report title, using the advice on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/effective-report-titles" target="_blank">Effective Report Titles</a><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/effective-report-titles" target="_blank"></a> page to compose a strong title.</li>
      <li>Use whatever outlining system you prefer for now, as long as it shows major sections and their subsections. </li>
      <li>Start your outline by copying the list of required sections from the  <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/recommendation-report-criteria" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Criteria</a> page.</li>
      <li>Revise the basic information you have copied to make it specific to your report.</li>
      <li>Include notes under the sections and subsections if you like.</li>
      <li>Work through the entire report, from beginning to end. This is a first draft. You can revise and add material later.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">
      <div class="maroonbox" style="width: 270px;padding: 6px;margin: 0px 0px 6px 12px;float: right;">
      <img src="../../-images/noun_Tips_2021795.png" width="64" height="64" alt="" style="float: left;margin: 0px 3px 3px 0px;"/><strong>Tip: </strong>Your outline should include basic sections and subsections like the Table of Contents in the sample report, but it does not need to be as polished and complete. You are just starting to write your report, so you probably do not know all the details yet. You can include placeholder text or notes.</div>
    Compare your outline to the table of contents in the sample report from the textbook, on page 494. Your outline should include similar details to those you see in the example table of contents. Obviously the details will be different.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Make any additions or revisions to your working outline to add relevant information, based on your comparison.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Submit your document:
    <ul>
      <li>Submit your project here by 11:59 PM on Friday, April 9.</li>
      <li>If you need more time, submit your document later. The assignment will close on Friday, April 30. Realize  that I may not have time to provide extensive feedback on work submitted after Wednesday, April 12.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">After you have submitted your outline, copy the document into a new word processor file. This will be the first draft of your report. Begin filling in the sections in this new document, using the outline to guide your work and ensure you add everything that is required. Upcoming writing activities will walk you through the sections.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>Be sure to track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/126055/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
  <li>Traci will add the related points to Canvas when she marks your work Complete.<br>
    <em>Why this change?</em> To allow everyone a longer grace period. This system will still give you the points you earn, but it gives you longer to earn them. </li>
