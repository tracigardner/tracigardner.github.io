    </figure>
<p>Return to your Research Description and you work log to find all the information your recorded on researching your topic (both primary and secondary research). Using the recorded information and other notes you have, write the Methods section of your Recommendation Report.</p>
<h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
<p>The Methods section is where you tell your readers about the research you did.  I am breaking the report out, section-by-section, to guide you through the process of writing the document and help make sure you include everything that is required for a complete report.</p>
<h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>
<ul>
  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">The details on the Methods Section, from p. 493:<br>
        “The methods section answers the question ‘What did you do?’ In drafting the methods section, consider your readers&rsquo; knowledge of the field, their perception of you, and the uniqueness of the project, as well as their reasons for reading the report and their attitudes toward the project. Provide enough information to enable readers to understand what you did and why you did it that way. If others will be using the report to duplicate your methods, include sufficient detail.”</li>
      <li class="skipline">Example  Methods Section, on pp.512–515 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">LinkedIn Learning video, “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/technical-writing-reports/include-methodology-and-procedures?u=57888345" target="_target">Include methodology and procedures</a>” (4m 11s), from the Technical Writing: Reports course.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>When to Do It</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li><strong>Suggested Due Date:</strong> By 11:59 PM on Friday, November 12, 2021.</li>
  <li><strong>Timely Feedback Date: </strong> If you need more time, take more time. You need this section for your completed report.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Chance Date:</strong> The  grace period for your recommendation report ends at 11:59 PM on Friday, December 3, 2021.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How You Do It</h2>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Return to the Research Description and the Work Logs you have submitted, and locate all the information you recorded on researching your topic (both primary and secondary research). </li>
  <li class="skipline">Open the word processor document where you are working on your recommendation report. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Scroll through the outline you created to the location for your Methods section.</li>
        <div class="maroonbox" style="width: 330px;float: right;margin-left: 12px;padding: 6px;">
        <h4>Tips for Writing Sub-Headings</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Include each major area in your Research Description in your Methods section. </li>
        <li>Refer to your Work Logs to  include all the work you did while conducting research.</li>
        <li>Use the  headings in the Methods Section of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8 of the textbook as a model.</li>
        <li>Consult the advice in the “Writing Clear, Informative Headings,” section on pp. 199–202 (in Chapter 9 of the textbook).</li>
        <li>Use the help on the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/professional-design-for-reports" target="_blank">Professional Design for Reports page</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <li class="skipline">Make any changes necessary to the headings for the sub-sections of your Methods Section:
    <ul>
      <li>If you have already worked on your Results Section, copy the sub-headings from your Results Section to the Methods Section. The sub-headings in these two sections typically match.</li>
      <li>If you have not worked on your Methods Section, choose one of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>If you added sub-sections when you created your outline, check your headings to ensure that you have included all the tasks you completed in your research. </li>
          <li>If you did not include sub-sections in your outline, add them now, covering all the tasks that you completed in your research.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Write the content for the Methods Section:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Sort the information from your Work Log into the different sub-sections of your Methods section. </li>
      <li>Expand on the information with other notes and information that you have.</li>
      <li>Include a reference to the Instructions that you created and followed to collect your primary research. [Note: The Instructions document itself will go in an appendix, not in the Methods section. Just describe what you did here.]</li>
      <li>Work back through the information you have added to make sure you have sentences and clear ideas.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Review the section and make any additions or changes, using the information from the textbook and LinkedIn Learning videos as needed. At this point, focus in particular in making sure that you have included everything that answers the question, &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; </li>
  <li class="skipline">Move on to the next part of the report that you want to work on.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Assess &amp; Track Your Work</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>Be sure to track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
  <li>I will give you feedback when you turn in your body draft to one of the feedback discussions. 
  Since this is a part of the working draft for your Recommendation Report, you do not  turn it in separately. </li>
