<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze the rhetorical situation and determine the appropriate audience or users of written communication, considering the needs of global audiences and people with disabilities. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 1]</li>
  <li>Conduct research appropriate to workplace problem solving, such as literature review, evaluation of online resources, interview, and site inspection. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 2]</li>
  <li>Interpret research findings with understanding of ethical and human implications. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 3]</li>
  <li>Use conventions of various workplace genres, such as proposals, instructions, correspondence, reports, and slide decks, with understanding of how the genre conventions can be used as heuristics and as principles of arrangement. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 4]</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Task</h2>
    <figure style="float: center;margin: 9px;">
        <img src="../../-images/recommendation/Rec-report-body-methods.png" alt="Flowchart from textbook, showing this is the first section of the report body: 1. Methods. What did you do? 2. Results. What did you see or determine? 3. Conclusions. What does it mean? 4. Recommendations. What should we do? " width="600" height="162">
        <figcaption style="color: #861f41;font-size: 1em;">The Sections of the Body of the Recommendation Report</figcaption>
    </figure>
<h3>What I Want You to Do</h3>
<p>Return to your work log and find all the information your recorded on researching your topic (both primary and secondary research). Using the recorded information and other notes you have, write the Methods section of your Recommendation Report.</p>
<h3>Why I Want You to Do It</h3>
<p>The Methods section is where you tell your readers about the research you did. This section is one of the required parts of your recommendation report. I am breaking the report out, section-by-section, to guide you through the process of writing the document and help make sure you include everything that is required for a complete report.</p>
<h3>Where You Can Find Help</h3>
<ul>
  <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">The details on the Methods Section, from p. 479:<br>
        “The methods section answers the question ‘What did you do?’ In drafting the methods section, consider your readers&rsquo; knowledge of the field, their perception of you, and the uniqueness of the project, as well as their reasons for reading the report and their attitudes toward the project. Provide enough information to enable readers to understand what you did and why you did it that way. If others will be using the report to duplicate your methods, include sufficient detail.”</li>
      <li class="skipline">Example  Methods Section, on pp. 498–501 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">LinkedIn Learning video, “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/technical-writing-reports/include-methodology-and-procedures?u=57888345" target="_target">Include methodology and procedures</a>” (4m 11s), from the Technical Writing: Reports course.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How You Do It</h3>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Return to the Work Logs you have submitted (You can find them all on the Grades page) and locate all the information you recorded on researching your topic (both primary and secondary research). </li>
  <li class="skipline">Open the word processor document where you are working on your recommendation report. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Scroll through the outline you created to the location for your Methods section.</li>
        <div class="maroonbox" style="width: 330px;float: right;margin-left: 12px;padding: 6px;">
        <h4>Tips for Writing Sub-Headings</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Refer to your Work Logs to  include all the work you did while conducting research.</li>
        <li>Use the  headings in the Methods Section of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8 of the textbook as a model.</li>
        <li>Consult the advice in the “Writing Clear, Informative Headings,” section on pp. 194–197 (in Chapter 9 of the textbook).</li>
        <li>Use the help on these pages: <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/information-rich-signposts-help-readers" target="_target">Information-Rich Signposts Help Readers</a> and <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/use-strong-phrasing-in-your-headings" target="_blank">Use Strong Phrasing in Your Headings</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <li class="skipline">Make any changes necessary to the headings for the sub-sections of your Methods Section:
    <ul>
      <li>If you have already worked on your Results Section, copy the sub-headings from your Results Section to the Methods Section. The sub-headings in these two sections typically match.</li>
      <li>If you have not worked on your Methods Section, choose one of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>If you added sub-sections when you created your outline, check your headings to ensure that you have included all the tasks you completed in your research. </li>
          <li>If you did not include sub-sections in your outline, add them now, covering all the tasks that you completed in your research.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  <li class="skipline">Write the content for the Methods Section:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Sort the information from your Work Log into the different sub-sections of your Methods section. </li>
      <li>Expand on the information with other notes and information that you have.</li>
      <li>Include a reference to the Instructions that you created and followed to collect your primary research. [Note: The Instructions document itself will go in an appendix, not in the Methods section. Just describe what you did here.]</li>
      <li>Work back through the information you have added to make sure you have sentences and clear ideas.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Review the section and make any additions or changes, using the information from the textbook and LinkedIn Learning video as needed. At this point, focus in particular in making sure that you have included everything that answers the question, &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; </li>
  <li class="skipline">Copy the information from your Methods Section in your word processor document, and paste it into text box below. You do not have to worry about the formatting here, only in the finished report.</li>
  <li class="skipline">Submit your work:
    <ul>
      <li>Submit  here by 11:59 PM on Friday, April 16.</li>
      <li>If you need more time, submit your document later. The assignment will close on Friday, April 30. Realize  that I may not have time to provide extensive feedback on work submitted after Wednesday, April 21. </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="skipline">Make a backup of your word processor document, because backups never hurt! </li>
</ol>
<h2>Obtaining the Points for Your Work</h2>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>Be sure to track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/126055/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/126055/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
  <li>Traci will add the related points to Canvas when she marks your work Complete.<br>
    <em>Why this change?</em> To allow everyone a longer grace period. This system will still give you the points you earn, but it gives you longer to earn them.  </li>
