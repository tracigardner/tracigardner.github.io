Next, choose a specific, local or observable situation that someone in your field could improve. Finally, you’ll write  a recommendation report to a specifically identified decision maker (the head of campus security, or town council, for example) describing the problem, listing your observations, offering solutions, and recommending the best way to solve the problem. </p>
<h2>Choosing Your Topic</h2>
<p>The topic that you choose for your report will depend on your major. One option is to identify a dangerous or inconvenient area or situation on campus, in a workplace, or in your community (for example, endless vaccination lines, an unsafe walkway, slippery stairs, a bad campus intersection). A civil engineer could choose a local intersection such as the one shown in the photo above and recommend a way to improve the situation.</p>
<p>The other option is to identify a problematic online resource (for instance, an inaccessible corporate website, a software task that is confusing to accomplish, or bad internal code documentation practices). A computer science major could take on one of these tasks. </p>
<p>You have a lot of latitude to choose something that interests you, but it does have to relate to your major and careers in your field. </p>
<h2>Requirements for Observing and Gathering Evidence</h2>
<p>As you decide on your topic, keep in mind the assignment’s requirements for observing the situation and gathering relevant data to use in your report: </p>
<ul>
  <li>For physical areas or situations, observe the problem for several hours during a peak use period (or as you can).&nbsp; </li>
  <li>For online issues, test and explore the related resources thoroughly. Have someone else try the online task and watch how they work (as you do in usability tests). You can also use industry standard benchmarking tools that relate to your topic (for instance, checking a website with an accessibility checker such as <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WebAim's WAVE</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only will you need personal observations, you will also need visual and/or audio evidence. You should take  photos&nbsp; or record videos that you can use to illustrate your report. If you are working with online situations, take screenshots and/or record the screen. Be sure that you choose a topic that you can personally observe. </p>
<h2>Requirements for Research</h2>
<p>Your report should  include a&nbsp;bibliography&nbsp;that provides documentation for all of the resources you have consulted. If you find resources as you are choosing your topic, save them and be sure to note the information necessary for bibliographical citations.</p>
<p>You may use the bibliographical format that is appropriate for your field (for instance, and electrical engineer would use IEEE format). Here are some tools you can use to track your sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;">
    <ul>
      <li><a title="EasyBib" href="http://easybib.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasyBib online citation builder</a>&nbsp;creates MLA-format for free.</li>
      <li><a title="Citation Machine" href="http://www.citationmachine.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Son of Citation Machine&nbsp;</a>creates MLA, APA, and Chicago citations for free.</li>
      <li><a title="Cite This For Me" href="https://www.citethisforme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cite This For Me</a>&nbsp;creates several styles, including IEEE, for free.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Identifying Ethical Issues</h2>
<p>Your report should include details on ethical issues that may impact the situation. Use the information in Chapter 2 of Markel and Selber, “Understanding Ethical and Legal Considerations” to identify how ethical concerns impact the situation and your potential recommendation. You can also consult information on ethical issues important in your field, such as personal safety, environmental protection, or cybersecurity. Make sure that you choose a topic that you can relate to ethics in your field.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Additional Recommendation Report Requirements</h2>
<p>I will share more details about the report as we continue working on the project. You can look at the <span style="margin-bottom: 9px;">Sample Report, Figure 18.8, on pages 490&ndash;513 of Markel and Selber, to see what the expectations for your project.</span></p>
<p>There are a couple of points to keep in mind as you choose your topic: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Your report must be  an original project, written by you, not copied or rephrased from another source. If you copy or rephrase from another source, you will earn zero points for the project.</li>
  <li>You will work on this project for the rest of the term. Choose something that interests you. You don’t want to spend the whole term working on a topic you hate!</li>
</ul>
