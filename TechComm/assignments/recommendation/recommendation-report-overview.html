<p>The Recommendation Report connects all of the writing projects in this course. It includes several kinds of writing, which we will explore one-by-one. This process will help you assemble the full report over the entire term (rather than trying to write the whole thing all at once).</p>
<p><strong>Length: </strong>15–18 single-spaced pages, including images, appendices, and appropriate formatting. There is not a minimum or maximum page length, but be sure to include all of the required information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><strong>Example Report:</strong> See a general recommendation report in <span style="margin-bottom: 9px;">Figure 18.8: Sample Recommendation Report, on pages 504&ndash;527 of Markel and Selber.</span></p>
<h3>General Project Description</h3>
<p> In this report you  you will analyze a  website and makes recommendations for improving its content and design. Your recommendations will focus on the information on the site, how it is presented (the words and phrases), and what it looks like (the visual display).</p>
<p>NOT about how to redesign or coding</p>
<p>Connection to the course</p>
<h3><img src="../../-images/noun-requirement-review-2715189-861F41.png" width="50" height="48" alt=""/>Requirements for the Website You Choose</h3>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>Choose a website that <strong>uses the English language</strong>. I can’t read anything else well enough to follow your analysis. If appropriate, the site can use other languages in places. For instance, a sushi restaurant website might list dishes in both English and Japanese. If you’re unsure, ask me.</li>
  <li>Identify a website that includes <strong>at least 6–12 pages of  content</strong> that you can navigate and observe without a login. Alternately, choose a website that following your recommendations would be reorganized into at least six pages. 
    <ul class="null">
      <li>For our purposes, a <em>page of content</em>  fills about &#8532; or more of the space in a browser window on a laptop or computer monitor. </li>
      <li>The content on a page can include images, text, form fields.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Find a website for a <strong>small business, nonprofit, organization, or other group</strong>. Do NOT choose local franchises of national or international businesses since they typically use an organization-wide site. </li>
  <li>Choose <strong>a local website</strong>. Specifically, select a website for a business or group that is located in Blacksburg, Christiansburg, or Montgomery County—all in Virginia. This area includes the Virginia Tech campus. </li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you identify a website for a food bank, a campus department, or a local religious community. You can review the Recommendation Website Examples page for help.</p>
<p>You have a lot of latitude to choose something that interests you, as long as it relates to your major and careers in your field. Use the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/recommendation-report-topic-examples" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Topic Examples</a> to guide your decision.</p>
<h3>Requirements for the Basic Situation</h3>
  <p><strong>Relevant to Your Major or Military Career</strong>: The topic that you choose for your report will depend on your major. Think about the kinds of work that people in your field and the kinds of improvements they suggest. If you are commissioning into the military rather than your career field, your topic may relate to that work instead.</p>
<p><strong>An Observable Problem or Challenge:</strong> Choose a specific local and observable situation that someone in your field could improve. The topic you choose should be something that you can personally see. If you are considering a topic that exists online, you need to have full access to the computer program or website. Otherwise, you need to be geographically near the area where the situation exists. The recommendation report requires primary research that you will not be able to complete if you are not physically near the area you are focusing on.</p>
<p><strong>Addressed to a Specific Person or Group:</strong> Choose a topic that allows you to address a specific decision maker (the head of campus security, or town council, for example) You will need to identify the name(s) of whomever you address in your report. For an issue that exists online, you should find the name of the employee at the company or organization who is able to make the change you suggest.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting to You Personally:</strong> We will work on this report the entire term, so  your topic needs to be something that will maintain your interests for  fifteen weeks.</p>
<h3>Requirements for Primary Research</h3>
<p>As you decide on your topic, keep in mind that you must be able to observe the situation and gather relevant data to use in your report: </p>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>For physical areas or situations, you can observe the problem for several hours during a peak use period (or as you can), or you can interview or survey others who deal with the area or situation.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>For online issues, you might test and explore the related resources thoroughly. Have someone else try the online task and watch how they work (as you do in usability tests). You can also use industry standard benchmarking tools that relate to your topic (for instance, checking a website with an accessibility checker such as <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WebAim's WAVE</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only will you need personal observations, you will also need visual and/or audio evidence. You should take  photos or record videos that you can use to illustrate your report. If you are working with online situations, take screenshots and/or screencasts. Be sure that you choose a topic that you can personally observe. </p>
<h3>Requirements for Secondary Research</h3>
<p>You should rely on support from books, articles, and webpages that address situations such as the one you have chosen. You can use resources such as a textbook from a course in your major, professional standards for your field, and government specifications.</p>
<p>Your report should  include a&nbsp;bibliography&nbsp;that provides documentation for all of the resources you have consulted. If you find resources as you are choosing your topic, save them and be sure to note the information necessary for bibliographical citations.</p>
<p>You may use the bibliographical format that is appropriate for your field (for instance, and electrical engineer would use IEEE format). Here are some tools you can use to track your sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;">
    <ul>
      <li><a title="EasyBib" href="http://easybib.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasyBib online citation builder</a>&nbsp;creates MLA-format for free.</li>
      <li><a title="Citation Machine" href="http://www.citationmachine.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Son of Citation Machine&nbsp;</a>creates MLA, APA, and Chicago citations for free.</li>
      <li><a title="Cite This For Me" href="https://www.citethisforme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cite This For Me</a>&nbsp;creates several styles, including IEEE, for free.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirement to Address  Ethical Issues</h3>
<p>Your report should include details on ethical issues that may impact the situation. Use the information in Chapter 2 of Markel and Selber, “Understanding Ethical and Legal Considerations” to identify how ethical concerns impact the situation and your potential recommendation. You can also consult information on ethical issues important in your field, such as personal safety, environmental protection, or cybersecurity. Alternately, you can address the ethical issues relevant to conducting your primary research. I can help you determine ethical issues if you are unsure what applies to the topic you want to consider.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirement for Originality</h3>
<p>Your report must be  an original project, written by you, not copied or rephrased from another source. Consider this the requirement not to plagiarize. I have had situations where someone copied and pasted an entire report from online. Don’t do that!</p>
