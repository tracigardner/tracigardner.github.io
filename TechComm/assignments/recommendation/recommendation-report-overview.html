<p>The Recommendation Report connects all of the writing projects in this course. It includes several kinds of writing, which we will explore one-by-one. This process will help you assemble the full report over the entire term (rather than trying to write the whole thing all at once).</p>
<p><strong>Length: </strong>15–18 single-spaced pages, including images, appendices, and appropriate formatting. There is not a minimum or maximum page length, but be sure to include all of the required information.</p>
<p><strong>Example Report:</strong> See <span style="margin-bottom: 9px;">Sample Report, Figure 18.8, on pages 504&ndash;527 of Markel and Selber.</span></p>
<h3>General Topic Description</h3>
<p> In this report you will identify a problem or challenge and recommend solutions, based on your primary and secondary research.</p>
<p>For your report, you have several options: </p>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>Identify a dangerous or inconvenient area or situation on campus, in a workplace, or in your community (for example, endless waiting in lines, an unsafe walkway, slippery stairs, a bad campus intersection). A civil engineer could choose a local intersection such as the one shown in the photo above and recommend a way to improve the situation.</li>
  <li>Consider a problematic situation on campus, in a workplace, or in your community (such as access to recycling options, a lack of support for diverse students, or recruiting more diverse members for a club). You might consider the need for better resources for nursing mothers at the company you worked at and suggest how the company could improve the situation. If you are on campus, you  could examine a subject that is important to your field but that is not represented in the courses that are currently part of your major, and then write a report that suggests how to better prepare people for their future careers.</li>
  <li>Focus on a way to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion on campus, in a workplace, or in your community. Your report could identify disparity between the student population and representation on a student advisory committee, or it could suggest ways to improve the diversity of hiring by recommending how and where to advertise position openings.</li>
  <li>Examine a problematic online resource (for instance, an inaccessible corporate website, a specific software task that is confusing to accomplish, or bad internal code documentation practices). A computer science major could take on any of these tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have a lot of latitude to choose something that interests you, as long as it relates to your major and careers in your field. Use the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/recommendation-report-topic-examples" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Topic Examples</a> to guide your decision.</p>
<h3>Requirements for the Basic Situation</h3>
  <p><strong>Relevant to Your Major or Military Career</strong>: The topic that you choose for your report will depend on your major. Think about the kinds of work that people in your field and the kinds of improvements they suggest. If you are commissioning into the military rather than your career field, your topic may relate to that work instead.</p>
<p><strong>An Observable Problem or Challenge:</strong> Choose a specific local and observable situation that someone in your field could improve. The topic you choose should be something that you can personally see. If you are considering a topic that exists online, you need to have full access to the computer program or website. Otherwise, you need to be geographically near the area where the situation exists. The recommendation report requires primary research that you will not be able to complete if you are not physically near the area you are focusing on.</p>
<p><strong>Addressed to a Specific Person or Group:</strong> Choose a topic that allows you to address a specific decision maker (the head of campus security, or town council, for example) You will need to identify the name(s) of whomever you address in your report. For an issue that exists online, you should find the name of the employee at the company or organization who is able to make the change you suggest.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting to You Personally:</strong> We will work on this report the entire term, so  your topic needs to be something that will maintain your interests for  fifteen weeks.</p>
<h3>Requirements for Primary Research</h3>
<p>As you decide on your topic, keep in mind that you must be able to observe the situation and gather relevant data to use in your report: </p>
<ul class="skipline">
  <li>For physical areas or situations, you can observe the problem for several hours during a peak use period (or as you can), or you can interview or survey others who deal with the area or situation.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>For online issues, you might test and explore the related resources thoroughly. Have someone else try the online task and watch how they work (as you do in usability tests). You can also use industry standard benchmarking tools that relate to your topic (for instance, checking a website with an accessibility checker such as <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WebAim's WAVE</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only will you need personal observations, you will also need visual and/or audio evidence. You should take  photos or record videos that you can use to illustrate your report. If you are working with online situations, take screenshots and/or screencasts. Be sure that you choose a topic that you can personally observe. </p>
<h3>Requirements for Secondary Research</h3>
<p>You should rely on support from books, articles, and webpages that address situations such as the one you have chosen. You can use resources such as a textbook from a course in your major, professional standards for your field, and government specifications.</p>
<p>Your report should  include a&nbsp;bibliography&nbsp;that provides documentation for all of the resources you have consulted. If you find resources as you are choosing your topic, save them and be sure to note the information necessary for bibliographical citations.</p>
<p>You may use the bibliographical format that is appropriate for your field (for instance, and electrical engineer would use IEEE format). Here are some tools you can use to track your sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;">
    <ul>
      <li><a title="EasyBib" href="http://easybib.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasyBib online citation builder</a>&nbsp;creates MLA-format for free.</li>
      <li><a title="Citation Machine" href="http://www.citationmachine.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Son of Citation Machine&nbsp;</a>creates MLA, APA, and Chicago citations for free.</li>
      <li><a title="Cite This For Me" href="https://www.citethisforme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cite This For Me</a>&nbsp;creates several styles, including IEEE, for free.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirement to Address  Ethical Issues</h3>
<p>Your report should include details on ethical issues that may impact the situation. Use the information in Chapter 2 of Markel and Selber, “Understanding Ethical and Legal Considerations” to identify how ethical concerns impact the situation and your potential recommendation. You can also consult information on ethical issues important in your field, such as personal safety, environmental protection, or cybersecurity. Alternately, you can address the ethical issues relevant to conducting your primary research. I can help you determine ethical issues if you are unsure what applies to the topic you want to consider.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirement for Originality</h3>
<p>Your report must be  an original project, written by you, not copied or rephrased from another source. Consider this the requirement not to plagiarize. I have had situations where someone copied and pasted an entire report from online. Don’t do that!</p>
