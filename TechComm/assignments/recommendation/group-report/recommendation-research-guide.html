        <p>The <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/recommendation-report-overview" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Overview</a> explains the basic requirement for primary and secondary research for your report. This guide will help you understand what you need to find to support your analysis and recommendations. First, I&rsquo;ll explain the difference between the two kinds of research, and then I&rsquo;ll share suggestions for collecting what you need.</p>

        <h3>Primary vs. Secondary Research</h3>
        <p><strong>Primary research</strong> is information that you gather personally. It includes data such as the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>observations and notes you take on them</li>
            <li>measurements you record</li>
            <li>experiments that you conduct</li>
            <li>interviews that you do</li>
            <li>questionnaires and surveys that you conduct</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What makes these kinds of research different from secondary research is that you (and your group) measure and record the information. It wasn&rsquo;t collected by someone else. </p>

        <p><strong>Secondary research</strong> is information that someone else has found or observed. You had nothing to do with collecting the details. Sure, you searched online or in the library, but the information you found was originally collected by someone else.</p>

        <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #861f41;font-size: 1px;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Primary Research for Your Recommendation Report</h3>
        <p>You and the members of your group can gather information on your website that you can then use in your report to persuade your reader why they should consider and accept your recommendations. Here are some ways to begin collecting your primary research:</p>
        <ul class="skipline">
            <li>Personal Observations<br>
                Each member of your group can visit the website and take notes on what they find. You can focus on immediate observations (think of them as first impressions), but you can also decide on some specific questions for each group member to respond to (e.g., What is the first thing you noticed on the page? What first impressions does the page make?). Since you are looking at a site with several pages, you can record these observations for each page.</li>
            <li>Readability Tests<br>
                Use the same tools you used to test your User Documentation to test out the readability of the pages of your group&rsquo;s website. Go back to <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/quizzes/462216" target="_blank">Try-It #7: Calculating Readability Statistics</a> to find links to the tools, and then apply them to your website. You can record things like the number of words on the page, the number of paragraphs, paragraph length, and grade level for each page.
            </li>
            <li>Accessibility Tests<br>

            </li>

            <li>interviews</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Not only will you need
            , you will also need visual and/or audio evidence. You

            take photos or record videos that you can use to illustrate your report.

            I strongly urge you to take
            screenshots and/or screencasts of the website so that you have details on it even if the site changes or is unavailable.</p>
        <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #861f41;font-size: 1px;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Secondary Research for Your Recommendation Report</h3>
        <p>You should rely on support from books, articles, and webpages that address website design and usability.

            Resources that discuss writing for online sites will also be useful.</p>






        <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #861f41;font-size: 1px;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Your report should include a bibliography that provides documentation for all of the resources you have consulted. If you find resources as you are choosing your website, save them and be sure to note the information necessary for bibliographical citations.</p>
        <p>You may use the bibliographical format that is appropriate for your field (for instance, and electrical engineer would use IEEE format). Here are some tools you can use to track your sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://easybib.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasyBib online citation builder</a>&nbsp;creates MLA-format for free.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.mybib.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyBib</a> creates MLA, APA, IEEE, ACM, and Chicago citations for free.</li>
            <li><a title="Cite This For Me" href="https://zbib.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zotero Bib</a> creates APA, MLA, Turabian, and Chicago for free.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also use the bibliography tools that are built into Google Docs and Microsoft Word:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-a-citation-and-create-a-bibliography-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5" target="_blank">Add a citation and create a bibliography</a>,” from Microsoft Word</li>
            <li>“<a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/10090962" target="_blank">Add citations and a bibliography</a>,” from Google Docs</li>
        </ul>

            document.getElementById("bottominfo").innerHTML = "<div id='helpbar'></div>"
            // The page is in an iframe
        } else {

            document.getElementById("bottominfo").innerHTML = "</main><footer><div id='footer'></div></footer>"
            // document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Page hostname is: " + window.location.href;
        }
