    <p>The Introduction provides an overview of the report that follows. It contains context, background, and forecasts the conclusions and recommendations. </p>
    <p>While the Introduction is the first part of the report&rsquo;s body, you may want to write the Introduction after you complete the other four parts of the body. It&rsquo;s easier to summarize your report after you&rsquo;ve written it.</p>

Refer to the research methods that you used as you list the tasks.
            See the third paragraph and bulleted list of the <a href="" target="_blank">Sample Recommendation Report</a>.</dd>
          <dt>Paragraphs 4 &amp; 5</dt>

          <h4><strong>Writing Well-Organized Paragraphs</strong></h4>
          <p>As you convert your answers to the nine brainstorming questions into your Introduction, make sure that your introduction flows smoothly. It needs to sound like paragraphs, rather than a series of answers to questions.</p>
          <p>Use these sections from the textbook for help:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the advice in <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/organization-writing-elements-and-organization?module_item_id=2493443#:~:text=Persuasion%3A%20Purpose.-,Paragraphs,-A%20paragraph%20is" target="_blank">the “Paragraphs” section</a> from the Resource Module: Organization.</li>
            <li>Find information on <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/transitions/" target="_blank">Transitions</a> on the UNC Writing Center site.</ </ul>
        </div>
        Reread your draft and revise your Introduction to make sure you have <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/organization-writing-elements-and-organization?module_item_id=2493443#:~:text=the%20next%20one.-,Transitions,-They%20provide%20movement" target="_blank">transitions</a>, full sentences, and clear ideas.
      </li>
      <li>Check your Introduction to make sure that any information you quote from your primary or secondary research is enclosed in quotation marks. </li>
      <li>Add <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/documentation-and-citations-for-your-projects" target="_blank">Documentation and Citations</a> anywhere that you include paraphrased information or quotations from outside sources. </li>
      <li class="skipline">Make sure that you have included everything that answers the question, &ldquo;What is this document about?&rdquo; in your Introduction.</li>
      <li class="skipline">Share your draft with your group and make additional revisions as necessary to connect with the other sections of your report.</li>
