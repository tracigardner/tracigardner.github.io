    <p>The Recommendation Report includes several kinds of writing, which we will explore one-by-one. This process will help your group assemble the full report over the rest of the term (rather than trying to write the whole thing all at once).</p>
    <p><strong>Length: </strong>10&ndash;15 single-spaced pages, including images, appendices, and appropriate formatting. There is not a minimum or maximum page length, but be sure to include all of the required information and sections.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><strong>Example Report:</strong> See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230925070528/https://www.macmillanhighered.com/brainhoney/resource/6698/digital_first_content/trunk/test/techcomm11e_full/techcomm11e_full_ch18_8.html" target="_blank">this general recommendation report</a> for an idea of the requirements for the project.</p>
    <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #861f41;font-size: 1px;width: 540px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>General Project Description</h3>
    <p> In this report you and your group will analyze a website and make recommendations for improving its content and design. Your group&rsquo;s recommendations will focus on the information on the site, how it is presented (the words and phrases), and what it looks like (the visual display).</p>
    <p> Your Recommendation Report should focus on readability, the use of plain language, and various aspects of document design and usability. Overall, you want the website&rsquo;s readers to have a positive user experience.</p>
    <p>Your analysis does NOT include technical aspects of web design and functionality. In other words, do not worry about coding your changes. You do not need any technical knowledge of HTML, CSS, or scripting to complete your analysis.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can mock up visual representations of the pages if you like in an image editor or word processor. </li>
      <li>Slide presentation software also works well. I used to mock up interface changes in PowerPoint.</li>
      <li>If you work with web design, you can mention technical capabilities, but the focus of your work should be on the words, images, and layout/design of the site and pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project directly relates to our course because technical writing focuses strongly on the best way to phrase ideas, strategies to organize information, and the layout and design that work best for different situations. Regardless of your intended career, you will need these skills to write effectively. As your group works on analyzing the website you choose, you are practicing strategies that you can use to analyze any document that you and your colleagues write in the workplace.
    <p>Additional information on the report is listed in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/177045/pages/recommendation-report-criteria" target="_blank">Recommendation Report Criteria</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="website-requirements">Requirements for the Website You Choose</h3>
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li>Choose a website that <strong>uses English</strong>. I can&rsquo;t read anything else well enough to follow your analysis. If appropriate, the site can use other languages. For instance, a sushi restaurant website might list dishes in both English and Japanese. If you&rsquo;re unsure, ask me.</li>
      <li>Find a website that fits with the expectations of <a href="https://www.inclusive.vt.edu/Programs/vtpoc0.html" target="_blank">Virginia Tech&rsquo;s <strong>Principles of Community</strong></a>.</li>
      <li>Identify a website that includes <strong>at least 8&ndash;12 webpages of content</strong> that you can navigate and observe without a login. Alternately, choose a website that following your recommendations would be reorganized into at least eight webpages.
        <ul class="null">
          <li>For our purposes, a <em>page of content</em> fills about &#8532; or more of the space in a browser window on a laptop or computer monitor. </li>
          <li>The content on a page can include images, text, and form fields.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Choose a website that allows you to address <strong>a specific person</strong> (the owner, the department head, the CEO, the manager, for example). You will need to identify the name(s) of whomever you will address in your report.</li>
      <li>Do not choose any website that I (Traci) have written.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #861f41;font-size: 1px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Requirement for Primary Research</h3>
    <p>As you decide on your topic, keep in mind that you must be able to observe the website fully and gather relevant data to use in your report. You need to test and explore the website thoroughly.</p>
    <p>Not only will you need personal observations, you will also need visual and/or audio evidence. You should take photos or record videos that you can use to illustrate your report. I strongly urge you to take screenshots and/or screencasts of the website so that you have details on it even if the site changes or is unavailable.</p>
    <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #861f41;font-size: 1px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Requirement for Secondary Research</h3>
    <p>You should rely on support from books, articles, and webpages that address website design and usability. Resources that discuss writing for online sites will also be useful.</p>
    <p>Your report should include a bibliography that provides documentation for all of the resources you have consulted. If you find resources as you are choosing your website, save them and be sure to note the information necessary for bibliographical citations.</p>
    <p>You may use the bibliographical format that is appropriate for your field (for instance, and electrical engineer would use IEEE format). Here are some tools you can use to track your sources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://easybib.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasyBib online citation builder</a>&nbsp;creates MLA-format for free.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.mybib.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyBib</a> creates MLA, APA, IEEE, ACM, and Chicago citations for free.</li>
      <li><a title="Cite This For Me" href="https://zbib.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zotero Bib</a> creates APA, MLA, Turabian, and Chicago for free.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also use the bibliography tools that are built into Google Docs and Microsoft Word:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-a-citation-and-create-a-bibliography-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5" target="_blank">Add a citation and create a bibliography</a>,” from Microsoft Word</li>
      <li>“<a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/10090962" target="_blank">Add citations and a bibliography</a>,” from Google Docs</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #861f41;font-size: 1px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3 id="requirements">Requirement for Originality</h3>
    <p>Your report must be an original project, written by your group, not copied from another source. Consider this the requirement not to plagiarize.<br><br><br></p>
