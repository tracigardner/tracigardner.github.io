    <h2>How You Do It</h2>
    <ol class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">Add the heading for your Methods section:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Add the word <em>Methods</em> as the heading at the top of the page and center the line. You can also choose the heading <em>Research Methods</em>.</li>

          <dt>Paragraph 4</dt>
          <dd>Add a sentence that introduces your task-by-task explanation of your research methods. See the fourth paragraph in the Research Methods section of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230925070528/https://www.macmillanhighered.com/brainhoney/resource/6698/digital_first_content/trunk/test/techcomm11e_full/techcomm11e_full_ch18_8.html" target="_blank">Sample Recommendation Report</a> for an example.</dd>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li class="skipline">For each task you identified in your research process, add a subsection with details on your research methods. Follow these guidelines for each Task subsection:<br>

          <h4>Tips for Writing Subheadings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the subheadings in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230925070528/https://www.macmillanhighered.com/brainhoney/resource/6698/digital_first_content/trunk/test/techcomm11e_full/techcomm11e_full_ch18_8.html" target="_blank">Sample Recommendation Report</a> as a model.</li>

        </div>
        <dl>
          <dt>Task Heading</dt>
          <dd>
            <ul>
              <li>Begin the subsection with a subheading that identifies the task by number and provides a brief statement of the task. Ideally your subheading should be approximately 1 to 1½ lines long.</li>
              <li>Format your subheading so that it is different from the paragraphs in the body. You can use the built-in headings in your word processor. See the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230925070528/https://www.macmillanhighered.com/brainhoney/resource/6698/digital_first_content/trunk/test/techcomm11e_full/techcomm11e_full_ch18_8.html#:~:text=The%20writers%20use%20the%20same%20task%20organization%20as%20in%20the%20proposal%20and%20the%20progress%20report." target="_blank">first task in the Sample Recommendation Report</a> for an example.</li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
          <dt>Task Details</dt>
          <dd>Provide the relevant details under each heading. Include the following information:
            <ul>
              <li>Explain background on how your began the task, including details on people involved.</li>
              <li>Provide information on how you conducted your research, moving generally in a chronological order. </li>
              <li>Explain the logic behind your methods to ensure that your readers understand your thinking.</li>
              <li>Mention any specific materials used in your research, such as questionnaires, surveys, and interview questions. Include the materials themselves in your Appendix. Add a page number to the materials in the Appendix when you first mention them in the Methods section.</li>

              <li>Add in-text citations for outside sources that you mention (for instance, books, websites, or videos) as you explain your findings, following these guidelines:
                <ul class="null">
                  <li>Make sure that any information you quote from your primary or secondary research is enclosed in quotation marks.</li>
                  <li>Follow the documentation style your group has agreed upon.</li>
                  <li>See the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/166227/pages/documentation-and-citations-for-your-projects" target="_blank">Documentation and Citations for Your Projects</a> page for help.</li>

              </li>



              <li>Review the information in your subsection, and chunk the information into short paragraphs. The exact number of paragraphs in each of subsections will depend upon the specific details of your research process.
