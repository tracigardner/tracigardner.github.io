    </figure>
    <p>Introduce your Recommendation Report to its primary readers, specifically the decisionmaker(s) the report is addressed to. Focus on the big picture so that the decisionmakers have all the basic information needed to determine whether to read the full report.</p>
    <h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
    <p>The front matter for your report may feel repetitive, but the items in the front matter have different audiences. I’m asking you to work on each of the sections separately so that you pay attention to the needs of each audience and help make sure you include everything that is required for a complete report.</p>
    <h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>
    <div class="maroonbox" style="width: 330px;float: right;margin-left: 12px;padding: 6px;">
      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Focus on Audience</h4>
      <p>Frame the information in your letter of transmittal for the decisionmaker. You will address the decisionmaker directly in the letter, and you will provide the details that they need to decide whether to read more of the report. You are giving the decisionmaker a fast summary of the report, focusing on issues that they care about.</p>

      <li>From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter 18:<br />
        <ul class="skipline">
          <li class="skipline">The details on the Letter of Transmittal, from p. 495:<br>
            &ldquo;In the letter of transmittal, which can take the form of a letter or a memo, the writer introduces the primary reader to the purpose and content of the report. In addition, the writer often states who authorized or commissioned the report and acknowledges any assistance he or she received in carrying out the project. The letter of transmittal is attached to the report, bound in with it, or simply placed on top of it. Even though the letter likely contains little information that is not included elsewhere in the report, it is important because it is the first thing the reader sees. It establishes a courteous and professional tone. Letters of transmittal are customary even when the writer and the reader both work for the same organization.&rdquo;</li>
          <li class="skipline">Example Letter of Transmittal, on pp. 504–505 (part of the sample recommendation report in Figure 18.8).</li>
          <li class="skipline">&ldquo;Elements of a Letter,&rdquo; on pp. 377&ndash;380 (in Chapter 14 of the textbook) <br>
            OR<br>
            &ldquo;Writing Memos,&rdquo; on pp. 386–388, and &ldquo;Guidelines: Organizing a Memo,&rdquo; on p. 388, (in Chapter 14 of the textbook)

    </ul>
    <h2>When to Do It</h2>
    <ul class="skipline">
      <li><strong>Suggested Due Date: </strong>By 11:59 PM on Friday, April 22, 2022, to participate in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/discussion_topics/1233622" target="_blank">Last-Chance Recommendation Report Feedback Discussion</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Grace Period:</strong> The grace period for this activity ends at 11:59 PM on Friday, April 29, 2022.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How You Do It</h2>
    <ol class="skipline">
      <li class="skipline">Complete a draft of the body sections of your report (<a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/writing-your-introduction" target="_blank">Introduction</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/writing-your-methods-section" target="_blank">Methods</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/writing-your-results-section" target="_blank">Results</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/writing-your-conclusions-section" target="_blank">Conclusions</a>, <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/146101/pages/writing-your-recommendations-section" target="_blank">Recommendations</a>) before beginning your Letter of Transmittal. It’s easier to summarize the report if you have already written it.</li>
      <li>Open the word processor document where you are working on your recommendation report. </li>
      <li class="skipline">Stay at the beginning of the document since the Letter of Transmittal is the first thing in the report.</li>
      <div class="maroonbox" style="width: 330px;float: right;margin-left: 12px;padding: 6px;">
        <h4><strong>Tips for Writing Strong Paragraphs</strong></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Begin your paragraphs with a topic sentence that previews the information in the paragraph. See &ldquo;The Topic Sentence,&rdquo; on pp. 207–209 of the textbook.</li>
          <li>Use the sections on &ldquo;The Supporting Information&rdquo; and &ldquo;Use Coherence Devices within and between Paragraphs&rdquo; as you structure your paragraphs. See pp. 209–214 in the textbook.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <li class="skipline">Decide whether you want to write a letter or a memo. Letters and memos have different formats. You can choose either, but be sure that you follow the format for the one you decide on. </li>
      <li class="skipline">Write the content for your Letter of Transmittal:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Add the headings that are appropriate for the format you’ve chosen (a letter or a memo).</li>
          <li>Begin your Letter of Transmittal with a paragraph that explains the situation for the report for the decisionmaker.</li>
          <li>Summarize the research methods you used in the second paragraph.</li>
          <li>Explain the main findings in your third paragraph.</li>
          <li>Describe your major recommendation in the fourth paragraph. </li>
          <li>Offer to provide more information if needed and thank your readers in the final paragraph.</li>
          <li>If you have chosen the letter format, add a closing and your signature block as well as any other required information. If you have chosen a memo, there is no closing or signature. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="skipline">Review your Letter of Transmittal and make any additions or changes, using the information from the textbook and LinkedIn Learning video as needed. The Letter of Transmittal is the very first thing someone sees when they receive your report. It is where you make your first impression. </li>
      <li class="skipline">Move on to the next part of your report that you want to work on.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to Assess &amp; Track Your Work</h2>
