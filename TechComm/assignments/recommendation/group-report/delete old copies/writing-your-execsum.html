    <h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
    <p>The front matter for your report may feel repetitive, but the different items in the front matter have different audiences. I’m asking you to work on each of the sections separately so that you pay attention to the needs of each audience and help make sure you include everything that is required for a complete report.</p>
    <h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>

      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Focus on Audience</h4>
      <p>Address readers at the management-level in your executive summary. Focus on the information that managers who provide support and leadership, but likely do not do the actual work to make your recommendations happen. Your readers would include people who work in purchasing, PR, hiring, and supervisors. You are telling these readers what they need to do to provide the resources and support to make your recommendations happen.</p>

guidelines writing an executive summary
Follow these five suggestions in writing executive summaries.

Use specific evidence in describing the background. For most managers, the best evidence is in the form of costs and savings. Instead of writing that the equipment you are now using to cut metal foil is ineffective, write that the equipment jams once every 72 hours on average, costing $400 in materials and $2,000 in productivity each time. Then add up these figures for a monthly or an annual total.
Be specific in describing research. For instance, research suggests that a computerized energy-management system could cut your company’s energy costs by 20 to 25 percent. If the company’s energy costs last year were $300,000, it could save $60,000 to $75,000.
Describe the methods briefly. If you think your readers are interested, include a brief description of your methods — no more than a sentence or two.
Describe the findings according to your readers’ needs. If your readers want to know your results, provide them. If your readers are unable to understand the technical data or are uninterested, go directly to the conclusions and recommendations.
Ask an outside reader to review your draft. Give the summary to someone who has no connection to the project. That person should be able to read your summary and understand what the project means to the organization.
