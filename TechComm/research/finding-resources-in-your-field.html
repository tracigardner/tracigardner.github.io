<h2>What You Will Learn and Practice</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How to analyze your audience and purpose so that you can choose supporting material that is convincing to your readers. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr> 1]</li>
  <li>How to find and evaluate ethical evidence in secondary sources, such as books, articles, podcasts, and videos, that supports your position. [<abbr title="Course Learning Objective">CLO</abbr>s 2 &amp; 3] </li>
</ul>
<h2>What I Want You to Do</h2>
<p><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/noun_Toolbox_3364151.png" width="200" height="200" alt="A toolbox with a pencil, hammer, and screwdriver inside" style="float:right;margin: 0px 0px 12px 12px;" />Identify research resources in your career field that you can draw on as you work on your recommendation report and which you can use in future projects. </p>
<h2>Why I Want You to Do It</h2>
<p>Every field has go-to resources that set the standard for research. By completing this activity, you will assemble your own custom research toolbox by collecting the standard resources you should begin with. Whenever you conduct research—here in college and in the field once you graduate, these resources are where to start.</p>
<h2>Where You Can Find Help</h2>
<p>Help with Canvas </p>
<p> From Markel &amp; Selber, Chapter  </p>
<p>From Course Webpages:</p>
<h2>When to Do It</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Suggested Due Date</strong>: By 11:59 PM on Friday, , 2021.</li>
  <li><strong>Timely Feedback Date:</strong> If you need more time, take more time. Turn your topic in by 11:59 PM on Wednesday, June 2, 2021 so that I can give you feedback before you need to finish your research.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Chance Date:</strong> The grace period for your work ends at 11:59 PM on Thursday, July 1.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How You Do It</h2>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li class="skipline">Review the information in Markel and Selber, Chapter 6 in the “Conducting Secondary Research” section (beginning on p. 121).</li>
  <li class="skipline">Consult the <a href="https://guides.lib.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Research Guide for your discipline</a> from the library to familiarize yourself with sources in your field. You can also talk to the librarian for your subject area. </li>
  <li class="skipline">Use a search engine to find additional resources in your field.</li>
  <li class="skipline">For each question listed below, provide the name and the URL of each site that contains information for your answer. For instance, as someone who teaches technical writing, I would list the following as part of my answer to Question 1: <br>
  The Association for Teachers of Technical Writing, https://www.attw.org/.</li></ol>
<h2>How to Assess and Track Your Work</h2>
<ol class="skipline">
  <li>Be sure to track your work in your <a title="Weekly Work Log Guidelines" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.vt.edu/api/v1/courses/132039/pages/weekly-work-log-guidelines" data-api-returntype="Page">Weekly Work Log</a>.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 42px;">When you submit your work, the points will be recorded in Canvas Grades automatically. I will review your answers. If I find that you did not put in appropriate effort or did not do the expected work, I will adjust your grade accordingly.</li>
</ol>
