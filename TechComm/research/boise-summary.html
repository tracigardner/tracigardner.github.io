        <p>Summaries are usually much shorter than their originals. A summary concentrates on only those points or ideas in a passage that are important. Unlike in a paraphrase, the information in a summary can be rearranged. Here is a passage from which summaries below will be taken:</p>
        <div class="maroonbox">
            <p>Numerous systems are available for controlling abnormalities [in boiling water reactors]. In the event that control rods cannot be inserted, liquid neutron absorber (containing a boron compound) may be injected into the reactor to shut down the chain reaction. Heat removal systems are available for cooling the core in the event the drywell is isolated from the main cooling systems. Closely related to the heat removal systems are injection systems for coping with decreases in coolant inventory.</p>
            <p>Both abnormalities associated with the turbine system and actual loss of coolant accidents can lead closing of the steam and feedwater lines, effectively isolating the reactor vessel within the drywell. Whenever the vessel is isolated, and indeed whenever feedwater is lost, a reactor core isolation cooling system is available to maintain coolant inventory by pumping water into the reactor via connections in the pressure vessel head. This system operates at normal pressures and initially draws water from tanks that store condensate from the turbine, from condensate from the residual heat removal system, or if necessary, from the suppression pool.</p>
            <p>A network of systems performs specific ECC [emergency core cooling] functions to cope with LOCAs [loss-of-cool- ant accidents]. (See Figure 6.) These all depend on signals indicating low water level in the pressure vessel or high pressure in the drywell, or both.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/-images/integrating-sources/bwr-emergency-core-cooling-systems.jpg" alt="Diagram of BWR emergency core cooling systems" style="margin: auto;" />
                <figcaption>BWR emergency core cooling systems</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The systems include low-pressure injection, utilization of the RHR system, and high- and low-pressure core spray systems. The high-pressure core spray in intended to lower the pressure within the pressure vessel and provide makeup water in the event of a LOCA. In the event the core is uncovered, the spray can directly cool the fuel assemblies. Water is taken from the condensate tanks and from the suppression pool. On the other hand, should it become necessary to use low-pressure systems, the vessel must be depressurized. This depressurization can be accomplished by opening relief valves to blow down the vessel contents into the drywell (and hence the suppression pool). Once this action is completed, the low-pressure core spray may be used to cool the fuel assemblies (drawing water from the suppression pool) or RHR low-pressure injection (again from the suppression pool) may be initiated, or both. The RHR system may also be used simply to cool the suppression pool. (Two other functions of the RHR are to provide decay heat removal under ordinary shutdown conditions and, when necessary, to supplement the cooling system for the spent fuel pool and the upper containment pool.)</p>

        <p><em>Sentence-length summaries</em>. Often summaries are only a sentence long. To create sentence-length summaries, use one or a combination of the following methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locate a sentence or two in the original passage that summarizes the information that you want, and simply rewrite it in your own words.</li>
            <li>If no individual sentence will work, locate several sentences that contain the right information, and combine them.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, the summary sentence is like a new sentence, scarcely resembling any in the original.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Extended summaries</em>. A summary can be longer than a single sentence because of the important information contained in the original passage. (Remember, however, that a paraphrase is a point-by-point recap of the original, while the summary is a selection, reordering and condensation of the original.)</p>
        <p>Guide for Using Summaries</p>
        <p>Whenever you summarize, you must handle the resulting summary the same way you would a direct quotation or paraphrase.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cite the name of the author and other important information about that author.</li>
            <li>Document that summary using whichever system is appropriate for your report.</li>
            <li>If it is an extended summary, make it clear where that summary begins and ends, for example, by referring to the author&#8217;s name at the beginning and placing a footnote or parenthetical reference at the end.</li>
        </ul>
